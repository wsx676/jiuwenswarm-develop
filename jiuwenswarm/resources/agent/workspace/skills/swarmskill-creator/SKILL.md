# Swarm Skill Creator

Authoring tool for Swarm Skills — the multi-role extension of the Skills standard. Encodes the Swarm Skill spec into a repeatable workflow with templates, decision trees, and an automated validator.

## Workflow

This skill has two independent routing dimensions:

1. **Operation mode** — what kind of authoring work is being performed.
2. **Output shape** — what files the resulting Swarm Skill should contain.

Pick both before writing files. Output shape is a separate dimension, not an additional operation mode.

| Mode | Trigger | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **CREATE** | User has a fresh need ("build a team for X") | New `<swarmskill-name>/` directory in the selected output shape |
| **CONVERT** | User points at an existing single-agent skill | Transformed `<swarmskill-name>/` directory in the selected output shape + a delta report |
| **MODIFY** | User edits an existing Swarm Skill (add/remove role, change workflow, adjust bind, fix validator errors) | Updated files in the existing `<swarmskill-name>/` directory |

Each operation mode maps to the staged pipeline defined below (see Stage 0–6). Quick routing:

- **CREATE / CONVERT** — share Stages 2–6; they differ only at Stage 1 (CREATE designs roles from scratch, CONVERT decomposes an existing skill).
- **MODIFY** — skips Stage 0–1 *unless* the change alters the team pattern; edits only the affected files; **always re-runs Stage 6 (validator)**.
- **Script-only output** — bypasses the role/workflow/bind/dependency stages entirely, since those files are intentionally absent.

### Output shape triage — Markdown, script-only SwarmFlow, or Markdown + SwarmFlow

Before Stage 0, classify the requested output shape. This is a silent routing step; do not ask the user unless their wording is genuinely ambiguous.

| Output shape | Trigger | Files to produce |
|---|---|---|
| **Markdown spec (default)** | User asks to create/convert/modify a Swarm Skill, team skill, multi-role team, roles, bind, dependencies, human-readable workflow, or self-evolution metadata, and does not ask for executable orchestration | Standard 5-file set only: `SKILL.md`, `roles/`, `workflow.md`, `bind.md`, `dependencies.yaml` |
| **Script-only SwarmFlow skill** | User asks for 工作流, workflow, SwarmFlow, `workflow.py`, executable orchestration, code orchestration, 可执行编排, or 编排脚本, without explicitly asking for a full team skill spec | `SKILL.md` + `scripts/workflow.py` only |
| **Markdown spec + SwarmFlow script** | User explicitly asks for a full team/SwarmSkill spec and also asks for 工作流, workflow, SwarmFlow, `workflow.py`, executable orchestration, code orchestration, 可执行编排, or 编排脚本 | Standard 5-file set + `scripts/workflow.py` |

Default is conservative in both directions: if the user does not ask for code orchestration, do **not** generate `scripts/workflow.py`; and if they ask for workflow/SwarmFlow/code orchestration *without* a full team skill spec, prefer script-only — do not expand to the full Markdown spec just because the output is still packaged as a Swarm Skill. In script-only mode:

- `SKILL.md` is still required and must contain valid frontmatter plus `## Workflow` and `## Files`.
- `roles:` must be omitted or empty in `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- The file set is exactly `SKILL.md` plus `scripts/workflow.py`.
- `scripts/workflow.py` is the executable orchestration surface and must be listed in `SKILL.md` `## Files`.
- All agent prompts, prompt-builder functions, schemas, and orchestration logic live inside `scripts/workflow.py`.
- If the user also needs rich role personas, gates, dependency contracts, human-readable team docs, or self-evolution metadata, use the full Markdown spec + SwarmFlow script shape.

Stage routing:

| Output shape | Stage route |
|---|---|
| **Markdown spec (default)** | Run the normal full-spec stages: Stage 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 |
| **Markdown spec + SwarmFlow script** | Run the normal full-spec stages, and add Stage 3b after `workflow.md`; revisit Stage 3b after `bind.md` if failure/retry behavior changes the script |
| **Script-only SwarmFlow skill** | Write minimal `SKILL.md` + `scripts/workflow.py`, then run Stage 6. Do not fabricate role files, prompt files, or Markdown spec files just to satisfy the full-spec pipeline |

### Stage 0: Triage — is a Swarm Skill even justified?

A Swarm Skill is **only justified** when at least one of these is true:

1. **Adversarial blind spot** — a single agent role-playing N personas produces converging outputs because it cannot escape its own analytical priors. Examples: PR review, security audit, design critique.
2. **Parallel decomposition gain** — N independent sub-tasks can run concurrently and the integration is non-trivial. Examples: multi-angle research, multi-perspective due diligence.
3. **Specialization pipeline with hard handoffs** — sequential stages with quality gates where blurring stage boundaries causes regressions. Examples: marketing copy (brief → draft → edit → audit), incident response (declare → triage → mitigate → postmortem).

**If none apply → STOP. Recommend a single-agent skill instead.** Swarm Skills cost more tokens, more wall-clock, and more authoring overhead. Do not build one out of novelty.

Ask the user: *"Which of these failure modes does a single agent hit on this task today?"* If they cannot answer, the Swarm Skill is premature.

### Stage 1a (CREATE only): Pattern selection

Pick the architectural pattern (A / B / C / mixed) based on Stage 0 justification. The detailed decision tree with worked examples is in [reference/pattern-selection.md](reference/pattern-selection.md). Quick reference:

| Pattern | When | Role count | Roles see each other? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Adversarial / Cross-check** | Justification #1 (blind spot) | 2–4 | No — isolation is the value |
| **B. Parallel decomposition** | Justification #2 (independent sub-tasks) | 2–N (variable) | No until integration |
| **C. Specialization pipeline** | Justification #3 (sequential expert stages) | 3–5 | Each stage sees prior stage output |
| **Mixed (A+B / B+C / C+A)** | Multiple justifications stack | 4–6 | Pattern-by-stage |
| **Debate (Mixed B+A+C)** | #1 + #2 (blind spot + parallel breadth) | 3–N+1 | Phase-scoped: isolated → mutual |

Read [reference/pattern-selection.md](reference/pattern-selection.md) before committing — picking the wrong pattern is the most common authoring error.

### Stage 1b (CONVERT only): Decompose the existing skill

Read the source SKILL.md and identify natural role boundaries. Use this checklist:

1. **Find embedded personas** — does the skill ask one agent to "act as" multiple roles (e.g., "Persona 1: Saboteur / Persona 2: New Hire / Persona 3: Security Auditor")? Each embedded persona is a Swarm Skill role candidate.
2. **Find sequential stages with quality gates** — does the skill have phases like "first do X, then validate Y, then produce Z"? Each phase is a pipeline stage candidate.
3. **Find checklists that branch by category** — a checklist like "[ ] security  [ ] performance  [ ] readability" is parallel-decomposition fuel.
4. **Identify what's lost in single-agent form** — the answer becomes the Swarm Skill's "why" (the Stage 0 justification). If you cannot articulate this, the conversion is not worth it.

Full conversion methodology: [reference/conversion-guide.md](reference/conversion-guide.md).

### Stage 2: Role design (count depends on pattern, no overlap)

Default role counts by pattern (soft heuristics, not hard limits — see [reference/pattern-selection.md](reference/pattern-selection.md) Q4):

- **A. Adversarial / Cross-check**: 2–4 roles
- **B. Parallel decomposition**: 2–N roles (use `count: [min, max]` for elastic fan-out)
- **C. Specialization pipeline**: 3–5 stages
- **Mixed (A+B / A+C)**: 4–6 roles total

If you need more, prefer splitting into multiple sequential Swarm Skills over one mega-swarm.

For each role, write 5 mandatory sections:

1. `## Identity` — **first line MUST be a 1-line motto** that crystallizes the POV (e.g., *"I am trying to break this code in production."*). This is the #1 anti-convergence mechanism. 0–2 paragraphs of context after.
2. `## Success Criteria` — bullet list + a "Focus areas" line.
3. `## Boundary` — explicit `**Forbidden**:` (prevent role overlap) + `**Mandatory**:` (prevent laziness).
4. `## Output Schema` — Markdown or JSON template.
5. `## Inline Persona for Teammate` — full pasteable prompt (most adopting agents do NOT auto-load role files; the Leader must inline this into the dispatch prompt).

Detailed authoring guide with examples: [reference/role-design.md](reference/role-design.md).

**Anti-overlap test**: write each role's 1-line motto, then ask *"could one role's deliverable substitute for another's?"* If yes, the boundaries are blurred — redesign before proceeding.

**Output**: write each role as `roles/<id>.md` using [templates/role.md.template](templates/role.md.template) as the starting skeleton. Delete the `<!-- TEMPLATE NOTES -->` block before finalizing.

**Auto-matching: assign locally available skills and tools**

After all role files are written, automatically match each role with locally available skills and tools. This is a **silent sub-step** — no user interaction needed (already-installed skills have zero adoption cost).

1. **Scan local skills** — use whatever mechanism the host framework provides. Common approaches (non-exhaustive):
   - **System prompt / context injection**: many frameworks inject an `available_skills` list at startup — this is the most reliable source.
   - **Workspace-level convention scan**: glob for `**/SKILL.md` under known skill directories.
   - **CLI query**: if the framework provides a skill listing command (e.g., `npx skills list -g`), use it.
   - **Do NOT hardcode paths for a specific framework** — the Swarm Skill spec is framework-agnostic.
2. **Scan local tools** — probe CLI tools available in the current environment (e.g., `gh`, `python`, `rg`, `jq`, `curl`, `docker`). Use `where` (Windows) or `which` (Unix).
3. **Match and assign** — for each role, read its `purpose`, `Success Criteria`, and `Boundary`. Evaluate whether any discovered skill/tool would materially help fulfil the role's purpose (a match = removing it would force the role into a significantly weaker operating mode). Assign matches to the correct field with `source: local` in `dependencies.yaml`.

   **Classification rule — do NOT mix skills and tools:**
   - `roles[].skills` → **Skills only**: items that have a `SKILL.md` (agent skills providing instructions/workflows). Examples: `web-research`, `code-review`, `canvas-design`.
   - `roles[].tools` → **Tools only**: CLI executables, MCP servers, or shell commands. Examples: `gh`, `python`, `rg`, `docker`, `curl`.
   - A CLI binary is NEVER a skill. A SKILL.md-based capability is NEVER a tool. If unsure, check: does it have a `SKILL.md`? → skill. Is it invoked via shell/MCP? → tool.

### Stage 3: Write `workflow.md` (mermaid + steps + gates)

Author `workflow.md` using [templates/workflow.md.template](templates/workflow.md.template) as the starting skeleton. Three mandatory sections:

1. `## Overview` — **mermaid `graph LR/TD`** showing Leader entry, parallel/sequential teammate nodes, decision diamonds (degraded mode branches), integration node, output node. Mermaid is the primary expression difference vs single-agent skills. **Debate pattern**: MUST keep the **inter-member communication preference** note from the template — do NOT delete it when replacing the mermaid placeholder.
2. `## Detailed Steps` — numbered steps; each step contains: executor / input / output / serial-or-parallel / **quality gate** (what to do if this step's output fails). The last step contains the final report format template.
3. `## Acceptance Criteria` — judgement of a successful single run.

Quality gates are the contract surface between stages — design them per [reference/role-design.md](reference/role-design.md) § Gate Design.

### Stage 3b: Generate `scripts/workflow.py` when requested

Run this stage only for **Markdown spec + SwarmFlow script** and **script-only SwarmFlow skill** output shapes.

For the full Markdown spec + SwarmFlow shape, Stage 3b has two passes:

1. **Topology pass after Stage 3** — translate `workflow.md` into phases, parallel/sequential structure, integration points, and role labels.
2. **Behavior pass after Stage 4** — revisit the script if `bind.md` introduces retry, timeout, budget, degraded-mode, or failure behavior that must be executable.

Do not let the script invent a different workflow from `workflow.md`; do not let `workflow.md` describe behavior the script cannot execute.

Generate `scripts/workflow.py` from [templates/scripts/workflow.py.template](templates/scripts/workflow.py.template). Before editing, read that template's `TEMPLATE AUTHORING CONSTRAINTS` block; it is the single full source for executable SwarmFlow script constraints. Keep this stage focused on routing and topology synchronization rather than restating those rules.

Choose the interaction primitive from the requested participant and memory semantics: one-shot human input uses `human`, stateful multi-turn human or agent interaction uses the corresponding session primitive, and one-shot agent work continues to use `agent`. The template remains the canonical source for call, lifecycle, and resource rules. Nested `workflow(...)` composition remains outside the supported surface and must not be generated.

For the full Markdown spec + SwarmFlow shape, the final script must match the topology in `workflow.md` and the executable constraints in `bind.md`: same phases, same parallel or sequential structure, same integration point, and no extra hidden workflow that the Markdown spec does not describe.

For script-only mode, derive the script directly from the user's requested orchestration. Keep `SKILL.md` minimal but explicit: describe when to invoke the skill, state that `scripts/workflow.py` is the execution definition, and list the script under `## Files`.

### Stage 4: Write `bind.md` (numbers + behavior + failure)

Author `bind.md` using [templates/bind.md.template](templates/bind.md.template) as the starting skeleton. Three mandatory sections:

1. `## Resource Constraints` — table with at least: `max_parallel_teammates`, `total_wall_clock_budget`, `total_token_budget`. Add per-role limits if asymmetric.
2. `## Behavioral Constraints` — **team-level** rules (Leader does not write content / teammates cannot see each other's output / Leader does not resolve contradictions / etc.). Distinct from per-role `Boundary`. **Debate pattern MUST include**: phase-scoped visibility rules (which rounds are isolated, which are mutually visible) AND the inter-member communication preference order (direct peer-to-peer > shared blackboard > Leader-relay).
3. `## Failure Handling` — must cover **(a)** teammate failure (timeout, malformed output, retry policy, how missing outputs appear in the report) and **(b)** input-overscale degradation (e.g., diff > 2000 LOC → degrade to single-role mode).

Heuristic: if a constraint has a number or an exception path, it belongs in `bind.md`. If it's the main flow, it belongs in `workflow.md`.

### Stage 5: Write `dependencies.yaml` + `SKILL.md`

The remaining two files. Write them last because they reference content produced in Stages 2–4.

**5a. `dependencies.yaml`** — use [templates/dependencies.yaml.template](templates/dependencies.yaml.template). This file codifies the **auto-matching results from Stage 2**, not a blank-slate design. Both `skills:` and `tools:` segments are mandatory — write `[]` if empty, but only after the auto-matching scan confirms no matches (signals "checked, confirmed none" — different from "never looked"). Each `roles[].skills` and `roles[].tools` declared in SKILL.md frontmatter MUST appear here (the validator enforces this).

**5b. `SKILL.md`** — use [templates/SKILL.md.template](templates/SKILL.md.template). This is the entry point that ties together all other files. Body MUST contain `## Workflow` + `## Roles` + `## Files`.

**Naming rules** (enforced by the validator):
- Directory name = `name` field in SKILL.md frontmatter (kebab-case, ends with `-swarm` by convention).
- Each `roles/<id>.md` filename MUST equal the corresponding `roles[].id` in SKILL.md frontmatter.
- All 5 files are mandatory (the validator fails on any missing file).
- Exception: script-only SwarmFlow skills require only `SKILL.md` and `scripts/workflow.py`; the executable script is the single source for prompts, schemas, and orchestration.

**Description discipline** (enforced by the validator — these are the most-violated rules):
- 3 lines, ≤ 500 chars (validator hard cap: 1024 — 500 is the target, not the ceiling).
- 3-line structure only: WHAT / WHEN / NOT. Do NOT add a separate `Triggers:` line.
- NO synonym enumeration — modern semantic match handles all variants from one natural sentence.
- NO numeric scope thresholds (e.g. `">200 LOC"`) → those belong in `bind.md`.
- NO Stage 0 justification rationale → that belongs in the body's intro paragraph.
- Per-role `purpose:` field has a ≤150 char HARD CAP. Detail belongs in `roles/<id>.md`, not in SKILL.md frontmatter.

**Calibration note**: 500 chars is the target; 1024 is the validator's hard ceiling. Swarm Skills are inherently more complex than single-agent skills, so the extra room exists — but use it only when multi-role composition or trigger scope genuinely needs it. Stay concise; don't sacrifice clarity for arbitrary brevity.

### Stage 6: Validate

Run the automated validator:

```bash
python scripts/validate_swarmskill.py path/to/<swarmskill-name>/
```

The validator checks two output shapes:

**Full Markdown spec**
- **Structural**: 5 files present, role file names match `roles[].id`, no orphan role files
- **Frontmatter**: `name` / `description` / `version` / `kind: swarm-skill` / `roles[]` present; each role has `id` + `purpose`; `name` == directory name
- **Section presence**: SKILL.md body has `## Workflow` / `## Roles` / `## Files`; each `roles/*.md` has all 5 mandatory sections; `workflow.md` has `## Overview` / `## Detailed Steps` / `## Acceptance Criteria` (and at least one mermaid block); `bind.md` has all 3 mandatory sections
- **Cross-file consistency**: every `roles[].skills` and `roles[].tools` in SKILL.md appears in `dependencies.yaml`; every `## Identity` in roles starts with a `> *"..."*` motto line
- **Output discipline**: `## Inline Persona for Teammate` present in each role file; `dependencies.yaml` skills/tools segments present even if empty

**Script-only SwarmFlow**
- **Structural**: exactly `SKILL.md` + `scripts/workflow.py`; no `roles/`, `workflow.md`, `bind.md`, `dependencies.yaml`, or `prompts/`
- **SKILL.md**: valid frontmatter plus `## Workflow` and `## Files`; `roles:` omitted or empty
- **SwarmFlow script safety envelope**: standalone script shape, inline prompts, safe imports, phase/agent consistency, human/session call discipline, workflow composition, budget guard discipline, schema permissiveness, and blocked runtime patterns

**Exit code 0 = compliant**. Non-zero exit prints the failing checks with file:line references.

The full script authoring constraint list lives only in [templates/scripts/workflow.py.template](templates/scripts/workflow.py.template). The manual checklist (for design-time judgment calls the script cannot automate, like "is this content really redundant?") lives in [reference/compliance-checklist.md](reference/compliance-checklist.md). Read it before declaring the Swarm Skill done.

### Post-generation: Creation Summary + Community Enrichment

After Stage 6 passes, present a **creation summary** to the user. This is the natural point to assess capability coverage and offer community enrichment — the Swarm Skill is already complete and functional, so community search is a zero-risk enhancement.

**Summary format:**

```
Swarm Skill: <name>
Pattern: <A | B | C | Mixed>
Roles: <count> (<list of role ids>)
Validator: PASS
```

**Per-role capability coverage:**

| Role | Assigned skills/tools | Recommend community search? |
|---|---|---|
| `<role-id>` | `<matched skills/tools, or "none">` | `<Yes / No — with reason>` |

**Recommendation logic — default is to recommend:**

For each role, evaluate whether to recommend community skill search:

- **Recommend** (default) — any role that could benefit from a **domain-specific** community skill. This includes roles that already have generic utility skills (like `web-research` or `curl`) but lack **domain-specialized** skills. A generic skill is NOT a substitute for domain expertise — see the anti-pattern below.
- **Do NOT recommend** — only when the role is **inherently self-sufficient**: its task is pure reasoning, judgment, or text generation that would not benefit from any external skill or tool. Examples: an adversarial critic whose job is to find logical flaws, a copy-editor whose job is to refine prose. These roles operate entirely within the LLM's native capabilities.

**Design intent**: the agent is structurally biased toward skipping community search. Reject the two common rationalizations:

1. *"No skills assigned → the role works on LLM knowledge alone."* A role *can* function, but a matching skill often dramatically improves output quality.
2. *"It already has a generic skill (e.g. `web-research`) → covered."* Harder to catch and equally wrong — generic retrieval is not domain expertise (see the anti-pattern below).

Default to **recommend**; the burden of proof is on *not* recommending. Test: *"Does a domain-specific community skill exist that would give this role capabilities beyond its current generic skills?"* If plausible → recommend.

> **Anti-pattern: "通用即覆盖" (generic = covered)**
>
> In `ecommerce-compare-debate-swarm`, three platform shopper roles (`taobao-shopper`, `pinduoduo-shopper`, `jingdong-shopper`) each had `web-research` assigned. The agent concluded "already covered — no community search needed." This is wrong: `web-research` is general-purpose retrieval; it knows nothing about Taobao store tiers, PDD subsidy eligibility, or JD self-operated logistics. Community registries carry platform-specific shopping and buyer-agent skills that fill exactly this gap.
>
> **Rule**: if a role's identity is tied to a specific platform or professional domain, a generic utility skill does NOT count as coverage — always recommend community search for domain-specific skills.

**High-signal scenarios — MUST recommend** (non-exhaustive):

- **Binary/office file output** (PPTX, DOCX, XLSX, PDF) — LLM cannot generate binary formats natively; needs a skill wrapping python-pptx / docx etc.
- **Diagram/chart rendering** (Mermaid, Excalidraw, matplotlib) — LLM can describe but cannot render visuals without a generation skill.
- **Specific file format parsing** (CSV, images, audio, JSON-LD) — specialized parsing/validation skill is far more reliable than raw LLM attempts.
- **Domain-specific platform / service interaction** (e-commerce, social media, financial services, travel, healthcare, government portals, etc.) — community registries often encode platform-specific rules, workflows, or API integrations that generic retrieval cannot replicate (e.g. 淘宝/京东/拼多多 shopping skills, 买手/personal-shopper skills).

If a role hits these patterns and no **domain-specific** local skill covers it, recommend "Yes".

**Community enrichment prompt:**

If one or more roles are marked "Recommend: Yes", ask:

> *"The following roles have no domain-specific skills and could benefit from community skill enhancement:*
> *[table: Role | Current skills (if any) | What domain-specific skill would help]*
> *Shall I search community skill registries? The Swarm Skill is already complete — this is an optional enhancement. (Y/N)"*

If user says **Yes**:

Read [reference/community-search.md](reference/community-search.md) and follow its full procedure. Quick summary:

1. **Derive search queries** from each role's `purpose`, `Success Criteria`, and `Output Schema` — generate 2–3 keyword variants per role (see §1 Keyword Derivation).
2. **Multi-source parallel search** — run both Tier 1 CLIs simultaneously:
   - `npx skills find '<query>'` (skills.sh — keyword matching, install counts)
   - `skillnet search '<query>' --mode vector` (SkillNet — semantic vector search, quality evaluation)
   - If results are insufficient, escalate to Tier 2 web platforms (LLMBase, SkillsMP, LobeHub) and Tier 3 curated lists (awesome-agent-skills, awesome-claude-skills).
3. **Quality gates** — every candidate must pass: install count (≥ 1K preferred), source reputation, security rating, freshness (see §3).
4. **Role-skill fit test** — verify capability match and run the removal test: "would removing this skill significantly degrade the role's output?" (see §4).
5. **Present enrichment summary** to the user with the standardized format (see §5) — full transparency on what was searched, found, selected, and rejected.
6. Install approved skills, update `roles[].skills` in SKILL.md frontmatter + `dependencies.yaml` with `source: <community-url>`.
7. Re-run `python scripts/validate_swarmskill.py` to confirm consistency.

If user says **No** → done. The Swarm Skill is fully functional as-is.

**Decision rules:**
- **Default: recommend** — empty `skills: []` = recommend community search; **also recommend** when a role only has generic utility skills (e.g. `web-research`) but lacks domain-specific skills matching its identity. Burden of proof is on NOT recommending.
- Prefer local over community — never search for capabilities already covered by a **domain-equivalent** local skill. A generic retrieval skill does NOT count as domain coverage.
- Per-role soft limit ≤ 1 community skill — if a role needs 2+, it may be too broad (consider splitting).
- Team-level soft limit: community deps ≤ role count — exceeding this signals over-engineering.
- Never force a dependency — mark `required: false` if the role can function without it.

## Roles

This skill has no Swarm Skill roles itself — it is a **single-agent skill** that authors Swarm Skills. The agent loading this skill plays the author/architect role.

## Files

## Common pitfalls

Detailed pitfall analysis is in the reference files — read them during the corresponding stage:

- **Role authoring mistakes** (motto, boundary, persona): [reference/role-design.md](reference/role-design.md) § Putting it together: a role file checklist
- **Content quality judgment calls** (anti-convergence, gate strength, bind numbers): [reference/compliance-checklist.md](reference/compliance-checklist.md) Part B
- **Pattern selection errors** (council of clones, pipeline without gates, decomposition without disjointness): [reference/pattern-selection.md](reference/pattern-selection.md) § Anti-patterns

The three most common **structural** mistakes (caught by the validator, but worth internalizing):

1. **Skipping auto-matching in Stage 2** — jumping from role design to empty `skills: []` / `tools: []` without scanning locally available skills/tools. Fix: always run the auto-matching sub-step; empty lists are valid only after the scan confirms no matches.
2. **`roles[].skills` declared in SKILL.md but missing from `dependencies.yaml`** — silent contract violation. Fix: run the validator.
3. **Mermaid in SKILL.md body** — duplicating the diagram from `workflow.md`. Mermaid belongs only in `workflow.md`.

## Quick start

For a CREATE request:

1. Confirm Stage 0 justification with the user (which failure mode does single-agent hit?)
2. Read [reference/pattern-selection.md](reference/pattern-selection.md) and pick A / B / C / mixed
3. Write all `roles/<id>.md` files (motto, boundary, schema, inline persona) + auto-match local skills/tools
4. Write `workflow.md`; if output shape includes SwarmFlow, draft `scripts/workflow.py` topology from it
5. Write `bind.md`; if output shape includes SwarmFlow, update `scripts/workflow.py` for executable retry/failure/degraded behavior
6. Write `dependencies.yaml` → `SKILL.md` (each using its template)
7. Run `python scripts/validate_swarmskill.py <swarmskill-name>/` until exit 0
8. Present creation summary with per-role capability coverage → recommend community search for roles lacking **domain-specific** skills (default: recommend; generic utility skills do NOT satisfy the threshold)
9. Manual review with [reference/compliance-checklist.md](reference/compliance-checklist.md)

For a script-only SwarmFlow CREATE request:

1. Use this path when the request mentions 工作流 / workflow / SwarmFlow / `workflow.py` / executable orchestration / code orchestration / 可执行编排 / 编排脚本, unless the user also asks for a full team skill spec.
2. Write a minimal `SKILL.md` with `kind: swarm-skill`, concise trigger description, no non-empty `roles:`, `## Workflow`, and `## Files`.
3. Write `scripts/workflow.py` from [templates/scripts/workflow.py.template](templates/scripts/workflow.py.template), deleting placeholders and template notes. Inline every agent prompt in this script.
4. Run `python scripts/validate_swarmskill.py <swarmskill-name>/` until exit 0.
5. Present the script path and explain that this skill is optimized for SwarmFlow execution, not full-spec role evolution.

For a CONVERT request:

1. Read the source single-agent SKILL.md
2. Apply [reference/conversion-guide.md](reference/conversion-guide.md) decomposition checklist
3. Articulate "what is lost in single-agent form" — this is the Stage 0 justification
4. Continue from CREATE step 2 (pattern selection) onward
5. Add a `MIGRATION.md` (optional) to the new Swarm Skill explaining the source skill, the decomposition rationale, and the team-vs-single delta

For a MODIFY request:

1. Identify the change type from the impact matrix below
2. Re-run the indicated stages; apply edits honoring the section + structure rules (mottos, Forbidden+Mandatory, Inline Persona, gates, numeric bind constraints)
3. Run `python scripts/validate_swarmskill.py <swarmskill-name>/` — **Stage 6 is mandatory regardless of edit size**

#### MODIFY impact matrix

| Change type | Re-run stages | Files to update |
|---|---|---|
| Edit role Identity / Boundary / Schema | Stage 2 (affected role only) | `roles/<id>.md` |
| Add or remove a role | Stage 1a + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 | All 5 files |
| Change workflow steps / topology | Stage 3 | `workflow.md` + `bind.md` (if constraints change) |
| Change bind constraints | Stage 4 | `bind.md` |
| Change dependencies | Stage 2 (auto-match) + 5 | `dependencies.yaml` + `SKILL.md` frontmatter |
| Edit SKILL.md description / purpose | Stage 5b | `SKILL.md` |
| Add, remove, or change SwarmFlow code orchestration | Stage 3b + Stage 4 if failure behavior changes + 6 | `scripts/workflow.py` + `SKILL.md` `## Files` if needed |

All rows require **Stage 6 (validator)** as the final step.
