"""Swarm team-spec enrichment entry point.

``enrich_team_spec_for_swarm`` is the single seam between the platform and the
provider-based assembly. Given a ``TeamAgentSpec`` it:

* registers all swarm providers / rail types (idempotent),
* builds the per-team base :class:`SwarmBuildContext` carrying the live runtime
  handles every provider needs,
* rewrites each present member spec ("leader" / "teammate") with its
  config-sourced rails and tools, and
* attaches the base context to ``spec.build_context`` so openjiuwen's
  ``setup_agent`` derives a per-member view through ``derive()``.

It never receives or inspects a pre-built ``DeepAgent``: members are assembled
purely from the config source plus provider name references.
