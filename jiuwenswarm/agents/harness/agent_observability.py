"""Single-agent / coding-agent observability lifecycle.

This is the non-team counterpart of the team observability adapter in
``jiuwenswarm.agents.harness.team.team_manager`` (``sync_team_observability``
/ ``shutdown_team_observability``). It is kept in a **separate file with its
own state and config section** on purpose, so the existing team scenario is
not affected.

Once ``openjiuwen.agent_teams.observability.init_observability`` has run, the
generic ``OtelCallbackHandler`` is registered against the **global**
``Runner.callback_framework``. LLM and tool events are emitted from the shared
foundation layer (``core/foundation/llm/model.py`` /
``core/foundation/tool/base.py``) for *every* agent, team or not — so simply
ensuring the provider is initialized before ``Runner.run_agent_streaming`` /
``Runner.run_agent`` gives single-agent and coding-agent runs automatic
LLM/tool span tracing. The team-only ``OtelTeamMonitorHandler`` (team/member/
task/message spans) is intentionally never attached here.

Shared-provider caveat (important):
    OpenTelemetry allows exactly ONE global ``TracerProvider`` per process,
    and ``init_observability`` is a no-op if already initialized. In a process
    where BOTH team and agent observability are enabled, whichever runs first
    wins; the other silently reuses it (its exporter/endpoint/service_name are
    ignored). To stay safe in that case we track ``_agent_owns_provider``:
    agent shutdown only tears down the provider when the agent actually
    created it, and never tears down a provider the team subsystem depends on.
