[JiuwenSwarm_Introduction.mp4](docs/assets/videos/JiuwenSwarm_Introduction.mp4)

**JiuwenSwarm** is an Agent system that makes multi-agent collaboration truly work. Designed for developers and teams who need to automate complex tasks, it helps users drive multi-agent collaboration, Skill self-evolution, and tool invocation through natural language — delivering end-to-end from intent to result. It runs on a single machine or across a cluster, and you can reach it from a browser, a terminal, or the chat apps you already use.

### Why JiuwenSwarm

| Capability                      | Value                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-Agent Collaboration       | The Leader decomposes a complex task and assembles teams, multi agents specialize and negotiate dynamically.                                              |
| Distributed Agent Swarm         | Leader and Teammates deploy across processes and machines, coordinating at scale.                                                                         |
| Swarmflow                       | Deterministic multi-stage workflows via Python scripts: the Leader hands off between stage agents; supports **HITL** (`human` / `human_session`), **team token budget**, and TUI **`/swarmflows`** run-tree monitoring. |
| Skill Self-Evolution            | Automatically detects error signals and user dissatisfaction, then optimizes Skill definitions                                                            |
| Skill Hub Sharing               | Capability assets are built once and reused everywhere, search, install, remix, and publish Skills through the Swarm Skills Hub                           |
| Auto Harness                    | Evaluation drive end-to-end optimization of the Harness itself, which learns and improves in practice with no model-weight training                       |
| AI Infrastructure Compatibility | Compatible with Huawei Cloud MaaS and other mainstream platforms, OpenAI-compatible APIs, and local models                                                |
| Tool Permissions & Security     | Every step is under your control, tools require approval before execution, file access goes through a whitelist, and sensitive operations are intercepted |

> For detailed installation instructions, see: [Install Guide](docs/en/InstallGuide.md)

## Quick Start

### Configure Model

JiuwenSwarm supports multiple model platforms: Huawei Cloud MaaS, OpenAI, DeepSeek, DashScope, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter and other OpenAI-compatible APIs, as well as local model deployment.

A default model is the one piece of configuration you cannot skip. Set it in the web UI under **More → Configuration**, or edit `~/.jiuwenswarm/config/config.yaml` directly. The file is created on your first `jiuwenswarm-start`, and saving it reloads the config without a restart.

For example, with DeepSeek：

```yaml
model_name: deepseek-v4-flash
api_base: https://api.deepseek.com
api_key: sk-your-api-key
model_provider: OpenAI
```

### Start a Conversation

The workbench has two spaces, switched from the top-left selector: **Work**, for office, collaboration, and general tasks, and **Code**, for viewing and modifying code in a project directory .

Each conversation runs in one of two execution modes, picked from the selector in the chat input area:

| Mode         | What it does                                                                            | Use it for                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent mode   | Single agent handles tasks independently, supports task planning and dynamic adjustment | Most daily tasks, Q&A, code generation, etc.            |
| Cluster mode | Multi-agent collaboration mode, with a Leader orchestrating multiple specialized agents | Large, complex tasks that need multi-role collaboration |

**Cluster Mode** (default)

Example input:

```text
Conduct an in-depth research on the new energy vehicle industry and generate an analysis report.
```

**Agent Mode**

Example input:

```text
Check today's weather in Beijing, and recommend 3 books about artificial intelligence.
```

In IM channels and the TUI, the `/mode` command switches between finer-grained sub-modes (`agent.plan`, `agent.fast`, `code.normal`, `code.team`, `team`). See [Modes](https://github.com/openJiuwen-ai/jiuwenswarm/blob/develop/docs/en/Modes.md).

By default, tools ask for approval before they run. If you would rather not confirm every step, adjust the policy in [Tool Permissions & Security](https://github.com/openJiuwen-ai/jiuwenswarm/blob/develop/docs/en/ToolPermissionsSecurity.md).

> For detailed operation guide, see: [Quick Start](docs/en/Quickstart.md)

## Channels

Enable a channel from the **Web UI**, or in `config.yaml` with `enabled: true` and the credentials for that platform, and you can talk to the same agent from an app you already have open.

| Region        | Channels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| China         | [Xiaoyi](docs/en/ChinaChannels.md#xiaoyi), [Feishu](docs/en/ChinaChannels.md#feishu-lark), [DingTalk](docs/en/ChinaChannels.md#dingtalk), [WeCom](docs/en/ChinaChannels.md#wecom-wechat-work), [Personal WeChat](docs/en/ChinaChannels.md#personal-wechat) |
| International | [Telegram](docs/en/InternationalChannels.md#telegram), [Discord](docs/en/InternationalChannels.md#discord), [Slack](docs/en/InternationalChannels.md#slack), [WhatsApp](docs/en/InternationalChannels.md#whatsapp)                                         |

Capabilities differ per platform. Xiaoyi and WhatsApp are private chat only; Feishu, WeCom, DingTalk, Telegram, Discord, and Slack also work in groups, usually by @mentioning the bot. Feishu and WeCom additionally support the Digital Avatar feature. See [Channels](docs/en/Channels.md).
