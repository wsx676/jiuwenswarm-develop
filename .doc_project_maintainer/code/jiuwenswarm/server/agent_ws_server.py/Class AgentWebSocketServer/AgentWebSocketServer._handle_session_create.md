issues:
  - id: ISSUE-001
    dimension: boundary_safety
    severity: critical
    status: fixed
    summary: "Untrusted explicit session IDs become authoritative filesystem identities."
    evidence: "Normal create rejects explicit IDs outside TUI; the TUI compatibility branch sanitizes the ID, enforces a 128-character limit, and is channel-restricted. See AgentWebSocketServer._handle_session_create/risks.md#issue-001."
  - id: ISSUE-002
    dimension: implementation_soundness
    severity: high
    status: fixed
    summary: "Create neither persists nor uniquely reserves a session."
    evidence: "Creation claims an AgentServer ID and writes metadata; TUI explicit-ID creation writes or reuses metadata while holding a per-ID lock. See AgentWebSocketServer._handle_session_create/risks.md#issue-002."
  - id: ISSUE-003
    dimension: side_effects
    severity: high
    status: fixed
    summary: "Team creation can stop distributed runtimes before success is observable."
    evidence: "For resolved mode 'team', current code awaits TeamManager.prepare_session_switch before encoding or. See AgentWebSocketServer._handle_session_create/risks.md#issue-003."
    suggested_action: "Separate creation from switching; make switching recoverable and classify send failures before retrying."
  - id: ISSUE-004
    dimension: test_coverage
    severity: high
    status: open
    summary: "Tests cover mocked success and one successful team switch only."
    evidence: "Direct tests now cover normal creation, TUI explicit-ID idempotency/concurrency, unsafe and cross-channel IDs, stable binding, warm bypass, and team preparation. See AgentWebSocketServer._handle_session_create/risks.md#issue-004."

# AgentWebSocketServer._handle_session_create

## Actual Role

Handles both AgentServer-allocated `session.create` and its scoped TUI explicit-ID compatibility form. It validates project/work-mode identity, claims an eligible warm or warming Session for normal creation, or validates and serializes a caller-supplied TUI ID while bypassing prewarm; it then persists or restores authoritative metadata, runs the switch-owner lifecycle, and returns normalized identity/status. The health audit remains expired pending an independent re-audit.
