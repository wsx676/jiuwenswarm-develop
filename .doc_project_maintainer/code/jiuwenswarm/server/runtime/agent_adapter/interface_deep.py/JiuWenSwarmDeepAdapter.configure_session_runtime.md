# JiuWenSwarmDeepAdapter.configure_session_runtime

## Actual Role

Builds the adapter's internal runtime-config bundle from stable session identity, channel, mode, and project inputs, then applies it without binding request-scoped capabilities. Diagnostic runtime-state persistence is scheduled and coalesced rather than synchronously probing Git on the AgentServer loop.

## Key Signals

- Input: prepared session identity and stable workspace context.
- Output: no value; mutates the session-scoped adapter runtime configuration.
- Boundary: public façade used by `prepare_session`, avoiding cross-instance access to protected implementation details.
- Verification: covered indirectly by the DeepAdapter reload and warm-pool preparation suites.
