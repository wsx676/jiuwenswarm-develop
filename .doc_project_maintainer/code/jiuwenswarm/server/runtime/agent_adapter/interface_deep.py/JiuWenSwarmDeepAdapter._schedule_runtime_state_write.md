# JiuWenSwarmDeepAdapter._schedule_runtime_state_write

## Actual Role

Coalesces diagnostic runtime-state persistence to at most one active task per adapter and runs synchronous Git/file probing in a worker thread under a process-wide bound of two writers. It returns without awaiting that diagnostic work. Lightweight or restored adapters that bypassed `__init__` treat a missing task slot as idle rather than failing request configuration.

## Key Signals

- Input: stable/request runtime identity and project context.
- Output: none.
- Main side effects: schedules a named task that writes a per-session YAML runtime-state file.
- Main risk: a request arriving during an existing write is intentionally coalesced rather than persisted separately.
- Related tests: `test_runtime_state_git_probe_is_non_blocking_and_coalesced` and `test_runtime_config_syncs_channel_and_task_workspace`.
