## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Conversation Overview

**Positioning of the Conversation Page**

The conversation page is JiuwenSwarm's core interaction interface. It is not only a chat window, but a **workbench for task intake and execution**. Through conversation, you can:

- **Ask questions**: Obtain information and clarifications
- **Assign tasks**: Let the agent execute concrete operations
- **Add requirements**: Adjust scope dynamically during execution
- **Track progress**: See task status and outcomes in real time

![Conversation page overview](../assets/images/conversation/chat_page_overview.png)

**Core Capabilities**

| Capability | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Natural Language Understanding** | Describe needs in plain language without memorizing complex commands |
| **Task Planning** | Automatically break complex requests into executable subtask sequences |
| **Dynamic Adjustment** | Insert new requirements or modify plans at any point during execution |
| **Tool Orchestration** | Automatically choose and combine suitable tools to complete tasks |
| **Result Feedback** | Clearly present the execution process and final results |

### 1.2 How to Start a Conversation

**Basic Workflow**

1. **Describe your request**: Enter your requirement or task in the input box
2. **Send the message**: Click send or press Enter
3. **Review the response**: The agent interprets your request and starts execution
4. **Continue refining**: Add follow-up requirements or adjust direction based on progress

![Conversation operation flow](../assets/images/conversation/chat_operation_flow.png)

**Tips for Better Prompts**

For better execution quality, include the following elements when describing requirements:

| Element | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Goal** | What you want to achieve | "Generate API documentation" |
| **Scope** | Where the request applies | "For all interfaces in the `src/api` directory" |
| **Constraints** | Special requirements or limits | "Use Chinese and output in Markdown format" |
| **Output format** | Expected output form | "Write to `docs/api.md`" |

**Prompt Quality Comparison**

| Recommended ✅ | Too vague ❌ |
|:---|:---|
| "Help me organize all Markdown files in `docs/zh`, verify heading hierarchy, fix formatting issues, and produce a change checklist." | "Organize docs" |
| "Analyze the code structure in `src/core`, generate an architecture diagram as PNG, and save it to `docs/architecture.png`." | "Analyze code" |
| "Translate `README.md` into English while preserving the original format, and write to `README_EN.md`." | "Translate README" |

**First-time Usage Suggestions**

- Start with **small tasks with clear goals** to quickly understand agent capabilities
- If the first result is not ideal, **continue adding requirements** instead of starting over
- Use **follow-up questions and refinements** to improve execution quality

### 1.3 Common Operations During Conversation

During task execution, you can perform the following operations at any time:

**Dynamic Adjustment Actions**

| Action | Description | Typical scenario |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Add requirements** | Append details or change direction on the current running task | Missing details, need to adjust output format or constraints |
| **Insert new task** | Add a brand-new independent task into the queue | A higher-priority independent need appears |
| **Interrupt task** | Stop a task currently in progress | Need to halt or change direction |
| **Adjust priority** | Reorder pending tasks | Re-prioritize execution sequence |
| **End task** | Mark a task completed or cancelled | Task is no longer needed |
| **View status** | Check current task list and progress | Understand overall progress |

> **Add requirements vs Insert new task**: "Add requirements" refines or extends an **existing task** (e.g., "also add charts to the report"), while "Insert new task" adds a **brand-new independent task** (e.g., "also translate another document for me").

**Core Feature: Adjust While Chatting**

JiuwenSwarm supports **real-time dynamic adjustment**. When you add new requirements while tasks are running, the system will:

1. **Understand the new requirement**: Parse your newly added input
2. **Assess impact**: Evaluate effects on current tasks
3. **Re-plan**: Integrate new requirements into the task queue
4. **Continue execution**: Proceed with the updated plan

**Example: Full Dynamic Adjustment Walkthrough**

The following example chains common dynamic adjustment operations, showing the complete process from task planning to execution, adjustment, and review:

**Step 1: Assign a task**

```
User: Process December invoice data and generate a summary report. Start by creating a todo list.

Agent: Task list:
  [1]	Get December invoice data file	🔄 In progress
  [2]	Read and parse invoice data	⏳ Pending
  [3]	Data cleaning and validation	⏳ Pending
  [4]	Generate summary report	⏳ Pending
  [5]	Output report file	⏳ Pending

▶ Start task [1]...
```

**Step 2: Insert a new task**

```
User: Also process January invoices, merge both months, and email finance.

Agent: Task list updated:
  [1]	Get December and January invoice data files	🔄 In progress
  [2]	Read and parse December and January invoice data	⏳ Pending
  [3]	Data cleaning and validation (Dec + Jan)	⏳ Pending
  [4]	Merge data and generate summary report	⏳ Pending
  [5]	Export report file and email finance	⏳ Pending

▶ Continue execution...
```

## 2. Execution Modes

### 2.1 Mode Overview

JiuwenSwarm supports multiple execution modes. Different modes fit different scenarios, and you can choose based on task characteristics.

![Conversation page execution modes](../assets/images/conversation/chat_execution_modes.png)

**Mode Comparison**

| Mode | How it runs | Best for | Characteristics |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Task Planning** | Decomposes requirements into concrete steps and executes by plan | Complex and multi-step tasks requiring progress tracking | Clear and controllable process; supports dynamic adjustment |
| **Performance Mode** | Handles requests flexibly and supports parallel tasks | Clear goals where fast results are preferred | Fast response; efficiency-first |
| **Cluster Mode** | Multi-agent collaborative execution | Large-scale tasks requiring specialized division of labor | Complementary capabilities; collaborative processing |

**Mode Switching**

You can switch execution modes in the following ways:

- **UI switch**: Select the execution mode at the bottom of the conversation page
- **Command switch**: Use `/mode` or `/switch` (see [CLI Commands](#3-cli-commands))

---

### 2.2 Task Planning Mode

#### 2.2.1 Concept Overview

**What is task planning?**

Task planning is one of JiuwenSwarm's core capabilities. It gives the agent **structured task decomposition and dynamic management**. For complex or multi-step requests, the agent automatically parses them into executable subtasks and systematically records/tracks them through built-in todo tools.

**Core Value**

| Capability | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Dynamic decomposition** | Automatically splits complex requests into executable subtask sequences |
| **Real-time tracking** | Updates subtask status as each step completes, making progress visible and controllable |
| **Flexible intervention** | Supports adding requirements or urgent insertions mid-execution without breaking the overall flow |
| **Goal preservation** | Reduces goal drift and execution gaps in long-running tasks |

**Applicable Scenarios**

- Tasks with many steps that need phased completion
- Tasks likely to change during execution
- Tasks where process transparency is important
- Tasks requiring confirmation at each stage

### 2.3 Performance Mode

#### 2.3.1 Concept Overview

**What is performance mode?**

Performance Mode (Fast Mode) is optimized for simple and clear tasks. In this mode, the agent will:

- **Respond quickly**: Reduce planning overhead and execute directly
- **Process in parallel**: Run multiple independent tasks at the same time
- **Prioritize efficiency**: Complete work as fast as possible

**Applicable scenarios**

- Tasks with clear goals and straightforward steps
- Tasks where fast results are preferred
- Tasks that do not require detailed process decomposition
- Multiple simple tasks that need batch processing

#### 2.3.2 Practical Example

**Case: Batch document rewriting**

```
User: Rewrite the following two technical docs so they are easier for beginners:
1. docs/api.md
2. docs/architecture.md

Agent: 🔍 Processing docs in parallel...

  Rewriting completed! Both beginner-friendly versions are saved.

  Original file                 Beginner version
  ContextCompression.md         ContextCompression_Beginner.md
  Heartbeat.md                  Heartbeat_Beginner.md

  🎉 Both beginner-friendly docs are saved in the same directories as the originals. Want me to refine anything else?
```

### 2.4 Cluster Mode

#### 2.4.1 Concept Overview

**What is cluster mode?**

Cluster Mode (Team Mode) is JiuwenSwarm's multi-agent collaboration mode. Multiple specialized agents work together, each owning a focused domain, to complete complex tasks.

**Core characteristics**

- **Specialized division of labor**: Different agents handle different domains
- **Collaborative execution**: Agents communicate and coordinate
- **Complementary capabilities**: Combine multiple specialized strengths
- **Result integration**: Aggregate outputs from all agents

**Applicable scenarios**

- Large-scale, cross-domain complex tasks
- Tasks requiring multiple professional skill sets
- Tasks difficult for a single agent to complete alone

#### 2.4.2 Practical Example

**Case: Full-stack project development**

```
User: Build a user management system including frontend UI, backend APIs, and database design.

Agent: 🤖 Starting cluster mode and assigning work:
[team_leader] I can help build a user management system. Before we start, I need to confirm several key details so the solution matches your requirements...

User: Use the default approach.

Agent:
[team_leader] ✅ Team formed and started!
[frontend-dev] Received! I have reviewed the task board.
[backend-dev] Project kickoff received!
[qa-engineer] Project kickoff received!
```

The screenshots below are ordered roughly as the conversation unfolds.

## 4. Conversation Logic

### 4.1 Execution Flow

Basic logic behind JiuwenSwarm conversations:

```
User Input → Intent Understanding → Mode Selection → Task Handling → Result Feedback
```

**Detailed flow**

1. **Intent understanding**: Parse natural language and identify real requirements
2. **Mode selection**: Choose an execution strategy based on task traits and current mode
3. **Task handling**:
   - **Task planning mode**: Decompose into subtasks and execute by plan
   - **Performance mode**: Execute quickly, with parallel support
   - **Cluster mode**: Delegate to multiple agents for collaboration
4. **Result feedback**: Present results in a clear and understandable way

### 4.2 Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism

JiuwenSwarm can re-plan task lists during execution based on new user input:

- **Real-time listening**: Continuously receive new user messages
- **Impact evaluation**: Evaluate how new requirements affect current tasks
- **Intelligent merge**: Integrate new requirements into the queue appropriately
- **Seamless continuation**: Keep execution flow coherent and uninterrupted

### 4.3 Task Planning Mechanism Details

**Core mechanism**

Core logic of task planning mode:

1. **Requirement parsing**: Parse user requests into executable subtask sequences
2. **Task recording**: Systematically record all subtasks via todo tools
3. **Status tracking**: Update each subtask status in real time
4. **Dynamic adjustment**: Let users insert, modify, or cancel tasks anytime

**Tool support**

JiuwenSwarm provides a complete todo toolkit (`TodoToolkit`). Tasks are persisted as Markdown in `workspace/session/{session_id}/todo.md`, isolated by session with concurrency-safe read/write.

| Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `todo_create` | Create the initial todo list |
| `todo_insert` | Insert a new task at a specified position |
| `todo_complete` | Mark a task as completed |
| `todo_remove` | Remove a specified task |
| `todo_list` | List all current todo items |

**Task states**

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `waiting` | Pending execution |
| `running` | In progress |
| `completed` | Completed |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled |
