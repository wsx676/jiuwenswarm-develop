# Slash Commands Reference

This document categorizes commands by **parsing location**: `TUI Local Parsing` and `Gateway / Agent Parsing`.
For quick reference of current behavior; final implementation follows the code.

## Key Command Details

### `/swarmflow` and `/swarmflows` (TUI local)

SwarmFlow-specific commands. Full walkthrough: **[TUI SwarmFlow Guide](TUISwarmFlowGuide.md)**.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/swarmflow` | Query status, e.g. `swarmflow: on · mode: team · budget: unbounded` |
| `/swarmflow on` | Set `enable_swarmflow=true`; switches to team if needed; optional `--budget <tokens\|none>` |
| `/swarmflow off` | Set `enable_swarmflow=false`; does not leave team automatically |
| `/swarmflows` | Open the full-screen run tree (workflow → phase → node); alias `/swarmworkflows` |

Config changes are **not hot-applied** in the current session (`Use /new to apply.`). Use **`h`** on the main view for pending human replies (not this command).

### `/workspace` (TUI Trusted Directory Management)

Manages directories AI can access for file read, edit, and execute operations.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` or `/workspace get` | Show system default workspace and current trusted directories list |
| `/workspace add [path]` | Add trusted directory (defaults to cwd; error if path doesn't exist) |
| `/workspace set <path>` | Switch the current project scope to this path and add it to that project's trusted directories |
| `/workspace remove <path>` | Remove specified trusted directory |
| `/workspace clear` | Clear all trusted directories (use default workspace only) |

#### Concepts

- **System default workspace**: Fixed path `~/.jiuwenswarm/agent/workspace`, always available
- **Trusted directories (`trusted_dirs`)**: User-authorized accessible directories, managed by TUI, passed to backend Agent
- **Project scope**: The project identity used to select the corresponding trusted-directory set and populate `project_dir` / `cwd` in requests

#### Control Logic

1. **Startup confirmation**: TUI prompts user whether to trust current directory
   - "Trust" → add current directory as trusted
   - "Don't trust" → use default workspace only

2. **Project-scoped persistence**: Trusted directories are stored by normalized project path in `~/.jiuwenswarm-tui/config.json`. `/workspace set` changes the active project scope only for the current TUI process; after restart, the launch directory becomes the scope again.

3. **Backend passing**: TUI passes `trusted_dirs`, `project_dir`, and `cwd` via request params; Agent restricts file operations and resolves project context accordingly

4. **Path restriction**: Agent limits file operations within trusted directories; operations outside require user confirmation

5. **Path validation**: `add` and `set` validate path existence; error shown if invalid

#### Aliases

`/workspace_dir`, `/workspace-dir`

### `/mode` and `/switch` (Controlled Channel)

- First-level entry mapping:
  - `/mode agent` -> `agent.plan`
  - `/mode code` -> `code.normal`
  - `/mode team` -> `team`
- Direct syntax:
  - `/mode agent.plan` -> `agent.plan`
  - `/mode agent.fast` -> `agent.fast`
  - `/mode code.normal` -> `code.normal`
  - `/mode code.team` -> `code.team`
- Second-level switching:
  - agent family: `/switch plan` <-> `agent.plan`, `/switch fast` <-> `agent.fast`
  - code family: `/switch normal` <-> `code.normal`, `/switch team` <-> `code.team`
- Invalid combinations (e.g., `/switch fast` under `code.*`) return: `Invalid command`.
- Controlled channels do not accept `/mode plan` or `/mode team.normal`.
- Note: Standalone `/team` command removed, use `/mode team` instead.

### `/resume`

- `/resume list`: List historical sessions.
- `/resume <conversation_id>`: Resume specified session.

#### Interactive picker (TUI)

Entering **`/resume`** or **`/continue`** with **no arguments** opens an interactive session picker (instead of a plain `session.list` dump).

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move focus between sessions |
| `Enter` | Resume the focused session |
| type chars | Live search (filter by session ID / title / project dir) |
| `Backspace` | Delete a search character |
| `Space` | Preview the focused session info card (title, ID, project dir, branch, message count, last active / created). In preview: `Enter` resumes, `Space`/`Esc` goes back |
| `Ctrl+R` | Rename the focused session. In edit mode: `Enter` saves, `Esc` cancels, empty value clears the title |
| `Ctrl+A` | Toggle scope between "all projects" and "current project only" |
| `Ctrl+B` | Toggle git branch filter (only show sessions whose `git_branch` strictly equals the current project's branch) |
| `Esc` | Clear search if any; otherwise close the picker |

> `Space` / `Ctrl+R` / `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+B` / `Esc` in the list can be rebound under the `ResumeList` context via `/keybindings` (preview/rename sub-states and search text entry stay hardcoded).

Behavior:

- **Defaults to listing all projects** (press `Ctrl+A` to narrow to the current project). When the current project has no sessions, an (empty) picker still opens so you can press `Ctrl+A`.
- **Branch recording & filtering (`Ctrl+B`)**: a session's git branch is recorded (per its `project_dir`) on the first message (`HEAD` for non-git/detached). When the filter is on, sessions are matched by branch **name** strictly; legacy sessions without a recorded branch and `HEAD` sessions are filtered out. Note the match is by name only and not repo-aware — with "all projects + branch filter" enabled, same-named branches in different directories are shown together.
- **Restore scope**: resume only restores the **conversation context** (history, session ID, accent color, workflow snapshot, window title); it does **not** switch the workspace / current working directory.

### `/model` (View / Add / Edit / Delete / Switch Model)

Manages model configs defined under `models.defaults` in `config.yaml`. Supports both text subcommands and an **interactive list**; delete/edit are done primarily through the interactive list.

- **Text usage**:
  - `/model` or `/model list`: Open the **interactive model list** (with current model marker); switch / add / edit / delete can all be done inside the list;
  - `/model <name>`: Switch directly to the model by name;
  - `/model add <name> key=value ...`: Add a model config via text form (e.g., `model_name=...`, `provider=...`, `api_base=...`, `api_key=...`, `reasoning_level=...`).
- **Interactive list hotkeys** (after opening the list via `/model` or `/model list`):

  | Key | Action |
  | --- | --- |
  | `↑` / `↓` | Select model up/down |
  | `Enter` | Switch to the selected model |
  | `a` | Open the form to **add** a model |
  | `e` | Open the form to **edit** the selected model |
  | `d` | Enter **delete confirmation** for the selected model |
  | `Esc` | Close list / cancel current action |

- **Delete flow** (`d` → confirm): After entering the `Delete model: <name>` confirmation page—
  - `Enter`: confirm deletion; the backend locates the entry by its **original index** (`index`, i.e. the position in `models.defaults` before filtering out multimodal keys like video/audio/vision), removes it, writes back to `config.yaml`, then triggers an Agent config reload (`AGENT_RELOAD_CONFIG`). Success response: `{type: "model_deleted", name, current}`.
  - `Esc`: cancel, return to the list.
- **Edit flow** (`e`): reuses the add form, but leaving `api_key` empty means **keep the original key unchanged**; only changed fields are submitted.
- **Limitations & validation**:
  - `video` / `audio` / `vision` are multimodal-only keys and cannot be set as the default chat model via `/model <name>`; use `/config edit` or `/config set` instead;
  - Deleting the **last** remaining model is rejected (`Cannot delete the last model`); an out-of-range index returns `model index not found`;
- **Config write behavior**:
  - Add / edit / delete mutate `models.defaults` in `config.yaml` (compatible with the old structure) and trigger an Agent config reload;
  - Switching model validates config and environment variable placeholders, updates `MODEL_NAME` / `MODEL_PROVIDER` / `API_BASE` / `API_KEY`, writes back to `.env`.
- **Secure display**: sensitive fields like `api_key`, `token` are masked in the list; only when models share **the same name AND identical provider+api_base** (genuinely indistinguishable) does the list append the key's last 4 characters `[…xxxx]`.

### `/diff` (Interactive Change Review)

- Usage: `/diff` (no subcommands).
- Applicable modes: All modes.
- Data source: TUI sends a `command.diff` request to the AgentServer (60s timeout). The handler resolves the current `session_id` and `project_dir` from request metadata, then fetches two data sets **in parallel** via worker threads:
  - `turns` — per-turn change sets derived from `.agent_history` file operation logs;
  - `gitDiff` — uncommitted working tree changes from `git diff HEAD`.
- Response payload: `{ type: "list", turns: [...], gitDiff?: {...} }`. On error: `{ ok: false, error: "..." }`.
- Display mode: Opens a **full-screen interactive Diff viewer**:
  - **List view**: Shows all changed files (working tree `working` and per-turn `Turn N`) with relative paths, source label, and added/removed line counts;
  - **Detail view**: Press `Enter` on a selected file to view its full hunk-by-hunk diff with scrolling support.
- List view keybindings:
  - `↑` / `↓` — Move selection (auto-scrolls);
  - `Enter` — View full diff for the selected file;
  - `Home` / `g` — Jump to top;
  - `End` / `Shift+g` — Jump to bottom;
  - `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` — Close.
- Detail view keybindings:
  - `↑` / `↓` — Scroll line by line;
  - `PgUp` / `PgDn` — Page up / down;
  - `Home` / `g` — Go to file top;
  - `End` / `Shift+g` — Go to file bottom;
  - `←` / `Esc` — Return to list view.
- Fallback: When the TUI does not provide the `enterDiffViewer` capability, falls back to inline display (file names, source, and line stats only).

#### Turn-based diff data source

Per-turn diffs are computed from `.agent_history/file_ops_jiuwenswarm*.json` logs, not from git. The service reads and merges file operation logs from multiple locations:

1. Agent workspace (`~/.jiuwenswarm/agent/workspace/.agent_history/`)
2. User workspace `.agent_history/`
3. Project directory `.agent_history/` (session-specific and global files)

Entries are deduplicated by path normalization and timestamp proximity (±1 second). Turn boundaries are defined by user messages in session history: a turn spans from one user message timestamp to the next. Only turns with file changes are returned; empty turns are filtered out. Turn indices are preserved (aligned with the actual user message count in history) to allow `/rewind` to map correctly.

#### Git diff data source

Working tree changes are obtained via `git diff HEAD` (tracked files only). The git repo root is resolved from `project_dir` (which may be a subdirectory). Staged renames (including brace shorthand form `a/{b => c}/d.txt`) are handled to align numstat keys with hunk keys.

#### Effect boundaries and limits

| Boundary | Value | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Max files in detail | 50 | Only the first 50 tracked files get hunks; stats still cover all changed files |
| Max lines per file | 400 | Hunks are truncated beyond 400 lines per file; `isTruncated` flag is set |
| Max diff size per file | 1 MB | Files whose diff exceeds 1 MB are skipped in hunk parsing; `isLargeFile` flag is set, stats still counted |
| Max files for details | 500 | If more than 500 files changed, only aggregate stats are returned (no per-file hunks) |
| Git command timeout | 10s | Git commands that exceed 10 seconds return `None` |
| Git root resolution timeout | 5s | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` that exceeds 5 seconds returns `None` |

#### What is NOT covered

- **Untracked files**: `git diff HEAD` only covers tracked file modifications. Untracked files are excluded from the git diff section. (Untracked files edited by the agent may still appear in per-turn diffs via file_ops logs.)
- **Manual/bash edits in turn diffs**: Per-turn diffs are derived from the agent's `.agent_history` file operation logs. Files edited manually or via bash commands are not tracked in turn diffs.
- **Committed changes**: Only uncommitted working tree changes are shown. Committed history is not covered.
- **Transient git states**: During merge, rebase, cherry-pick, or revert, git diff returns `None` to avoid showing misleading incoming changes.
- **Binary files**: Binary file changes are counted in stats but no hunks are shown (`isBinary` flag set).
- **Not a git repo**: If `project_dir` is not in a git repository, `gitDiff` is `None`; only per-turn diffs are returned.
- **No project_dir**: If `project_dir` cannot be resolved, `gitDiff` is `None`; per-turn diffs may still work using session metadata.

> `/diff` is not a replacement for `git diff` from a full version control perspective. It combines agent-tracked per-turn changes with a snapshot of uncommitted tracked-file changes for quick review within a coding session.

### `/compact` (Context Compression)

- Usage: `/compact` (no parameters).
- Function: Trigger context compression,清理对话 history but keep summary in context.
- Data source: TUI requests Agent compression service via `command.compact`.
- Results:
  - `busy`: Compression in progress, retry later;
  - `compressed`: Success, shows before/after token counts and savings ratio;
  - `noop`: No compression needed, context already optimal.

### `/context` (Context Window Usage)

- Usage: `/context` (no parameters, no subcommands).
- Function: View the current session's context window occupancy and token usage details.
- Data source: TUI requests Agent context statistics service via `command.context`, carrying the current `mode`.
- Display contents:
  - **Overview panel**: Context window occupancy percentage + progress bar; `context_window` (used / limit tokens), `occupancy` (rate), `messages` (count);
  - **Token breakdown panel**: Shows token usage by `system_prompt`, `messages`, `tools`, and `total`;
  - **DeepAgent occupancy details** (if available): Key-value list of `context_occupancy` fields;
  - **DeepAgent usage details** (if available): Key-value list of `deepagent_usage` fields.
- Threshold warning: When occupancy >= 90%, the overview title shows `Context window 90% full — consider /compact`.
- Error handling: On request failure, displays `context failed: <error message>`.

### `/init` (Project Initialization)

- Usage: `/init` (no parameters).
- Function: Initialize project AI collaboration config, generates `JIUWENSWARM.md` and optionally `JIUWENSWARM.local.md`.
- Scope: Only runs in `code` mode.
- Flow:
  1. Select scope: `Team-shared` (JIUWENSWARM.md), `Personal` (JIUWENSWARM.local.md), or `Both`.
  2. Detect existing configs: Auto-detect `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `copilot-instructions.md` etc.
  3. Generate configs: Create project config files based on selection.
- Auto mode switch: Code initialization runs in `code.normal` for write permission.

### `/mcp` (MCP Server Management)

- Usage:
  - `/mcp list`: List all MCP servers (name, transport, enabled status);
  - `/mcp show [name]`: Show MCP config; without `name` shows enabled items, with `name` shows one server detail;
  - `/mcp add --name <name> --transport <stdio|sse> ...`: Add a new MCP server;
  - `/mcp update --name <name> ...`: Update MCP server config (transport / params / enabled status);
  - `/mcp enable <name>`: Enable a specific MCP server;
  - `/mcp disable <name>`: Disable a specific MCP server;
  - `/mcp remove <name>`: Remove a specific MCP server.
- Transport parameters:
  - `stdio`: requires `--command`; optional `--args`, `--cwd`, `--env`;
  - `sse`: requires `--url`; optional `--headers`, `--timeout_s`.
- Examples:
  - `/mcp list`
  - `/mcp show`
  - `/mcp show playwright`
  - `/mcp add --name playwright --transport stdio --command python --args "server.py --transport stdio"`
  - `/mcp update --name playwright --transport sse --url http://127.0.0.1:9000/sse --headers "Authorization=Bearer xxx"`
  - `/mcp add --name local-sse --transport sse --url http://127.0.0.1:9000/sse`
  - `/mcp disable playwright`
  - `/mcp remove local-sse`
- Config and effect:
  - Changes are written to `config.yaml` under `mcp.servers`;
  - After write, Agent config reload is triggered, and runtime MCP server bindings are synced accordingly.

### `/evolve*` (Skill Self-Evolution)

These commands are registered and parsed by the TUI, then forwarded as slash text through the normal chat channel. The actual evolution logic runs on the Agent / Team backend:

- Agent mode: handled by `SkillEvolutionRail`; only `agent.plan` is supported.
- Team mode: handled by `TeamSkillEvolutionRail` for team skill evolution.
- Code mode and `agent.fast` do not support these commands.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/evolve <skill_name> [user_query]` | Trigger evolution for one skill. `agent.plan` scans the current conversation for tool failures and user corrections; Team mode requires `user_query`. |
| `/evolve_list <skill_name> [--sort score]` | Show one skill's evolution records with count, average score, usage/feedback stats, section, and content preview. |
| `/evolve_simplify <skill_name> [user_intent]` | Generate an approval-gated cleanup plan to merge duplicates, split long records, or remove low-value records. Trailing text is passed to the backend as intent. |
| `/evolve_rebuild <skill_name> [user_intent]` | Generate a rebuild follow-up prompt and continue as a normal Agent / Team task to rebuild `SKILL.md`. |

#### Approval Flow

- `/evolve` and `/evolve_simplify` do not silently write changes; the backend pushes a confirmation question and the TUI waits for approval.
- Accepting persists/solidifies the generated records; rejecting discards this generation.
- Accepted Team skill evolution syncs the team skill directory.
- While evolution or approval is pending, supplemental user input is queued and sent after evolution completes.

#### Examples

```bash
/evolve pptx improve export error handling
/evolve_list pptx --sort score
/evolve_simplify pptx merge duplicate export-failure records
/evolve_rebuild pptx strengthen Troubleshooting and Examples
```

### `/branch` (Branch Session)

- Usage: `/branch [name]`.
- Alias: `/fork`.
- Function: Create a branch session from the current conversation state, copying the current conversation history.
- Constraints:
  - Rejected when the session is busy (`session is busy`);
  - Rejected when the current session has no conversation records.
- Behavior:
  1. Send `session.fork` with `source_session_id` and an optional title. AgentServer allocates the target `session_id` and returns it in the response.
  2. TUI automatically switches to the new branch session, clears the current transcript, and restores the branch history.
  3. Prompts the user that they are now in the new branch, and informs them they can use `/resume <original_session_id>` to return to the original session.
- Examples:
  - `/branch` — Create an untitled branch
  - `/branch fix-login-bug` — Create a branch named `fix-login-bug`

### `/rewind` (Rewind Conversation)

- Usage: `/rewind [turn_number]`.
- Alias: `/checkpoint`.
- Function: Rewind or compact the current session around a specified turn, supporting conversation-only, code-only, both, or partial-history summarization.
- Constraints:
  - Rejected when the session is busy (`session is busy`);
  - Rejected when there are no conversation turns.
- Interactive flow:
  1. Without parameters, displays a list of all conversation turns (with timestamps and file change statistics) for the user to select the target turn.
  2. After selecting, displays restore options:
     - **Restore conversation and code** — Truncate conversation and restore files to their prior state;
     - **Restore conversation only** — Only truncate conversation, files remain unchanged;
     - **Restore code only** — Only restore files, conversation remains unchanged (shown only when the target turn has file changes);
     - **Summarize from here** — Keep earlier messages and replace the selected turn and everything after it with a compact summary;
     - **Summarize up to here** — Summarize messages before the selected turn and keep the selected turn and everything after it unchanged;
     - **Cancel** — Abort the operation.
  3. Calls the corresponding backend RPC based on selection:
     - `both` → `session.rewind_and_restore`
     - `conversation` → `session.rewind`
     - `code` → `session.restore_files`
     - `summarize` → `command.rewind_compact` with `direction=from`
     - `summarize_up_to` → `command.rewind_compact` with `direction=up_to`
- After rewind: TUI clears the transcript and reloads history; if the rewound content contains user input, it is automatically filled into the input box.
- Code-only restore reports `No file changes to restore` when there is nothing to change. Partial failures list every failed file and leave those files unchanged instead of reporting an unconditional success.
- Limitation: Rewinding does not affect files edited manually or via bash commands.
- Examples:
  - `/rewind` — Interactive turn selection and restore mode confirmation
  - `/rewind 2` — Directly rewind to before turn 2

### `/memory` (Memory Management)

- Alias: `/mem`.
- Function: View and manage memory system status, memory files, toggle settings, and directory paths via a tabbed console.
- Subcommands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/memory` or `/memory edit` | Open the tabbed console and select the edit tab |
| `/memory edit <path>` | Directly edit the specified memory file (via `$EDITOR`) |
| `/memory status` | Open the tabbed console and select the status tab |
| `/memory toggle` | Open the tabbed console and select the toggle tab |
| `/memory toggle <key>` | Directly toggle the specified memory system switch |
| `/memory open` | Open the tabbed console and select the open tab |

- Edit safety:
  - The target must already exist and be inside an allowed memory location; `/memory edit` does not create a new file.
  - Runtime auto/coding-memory files are read-only and cannot be edited manually.
  - Project or ancestor `JIUWENSWARM.md` / `JIUWENSWARM.local.md` files may be opened only when they already exist and pass the allowed-path checks.

- Tabbed console: The console has 4 tabs — edit / status / toggle / open. Interaction keys:
  - `←`/`→` — Switch tabs;
  - `↑`/`↓` — Navigate within the current tab;
  - `Enter` — Execute the selected item;
  - `Ctrl+O` — Toggle full path display (edit / open tabs); resets to default (relative path) when switching tabs;
  - `Esc` — Close the console.
- `edit` display contents:
  - Lists memory files in priority order: Project memory (Checked in at `<path>`), Local memory (Saved in `<path>`), User memory (Saved in `<path>`), plus any rule files;
  - `Enter` opens the selected file with `$EDITOR`.
- `status` display contents:
  - Engine (format `builtin (local)`, combining the storage engine and storage mode);
  - Switch row — mode-adaptive (mirrors the current mode's toggle set), shown as `✓ on` / `✗ off`:
    - agent mode: `memory_enabled` (Memory), `memory_proactive` (Proactive memory), `memory_forbidden_enabled` (Forbidden filter);
    - code mode: `memory_enabled` (Memory), `auto_coding_memory` (Auto coding memory), `memory_forbidden_enabled` (Forbidden filter).
  - Runtime memory statistics — mode-adaptive: agent mode shows "Auto Memory" (files / chars / dir); code mode shows "Coding Memory" (files / chars / dir);
  - Project Memory statistics (files / chars / project dir);
  - External Memory (provider + enabled status), shown only if configured.
- `toggle` display contents:
  - Each row shows the toggle **key** (padded to equal width), a `✓ on` / `✗ off` status marker, and a Chinese description. Only the key is shown (no English label); columns are separated by spaces, not `·`. Example (code mode):
    ```
    → memory_enabled            ✓ on   记忆功能总开关
      auto_coding_memory        ✓ on   每轮对话后自动提取记忆（需总开关开启）
      memory_forbidden_enabled  ✗ off  过滤敏感信息
    ```
  - Available keys (mode-adaptive):
    - agent mode: `memory_enabled` (Master memory switch), `memory_proactive` (Proactive memory), `memory_forbidden_enabled` (Forbidden filter);
    - code mode: `memory_enabled` (Master memory switch), `auto_coding_memory` (Auto coding memory), `memory_forbidden_enabled` (Forbidden filter).
  - After toggling, a prompt is shown if a session restart is required for the change to take effect.
- `open` display contents:
  - Lists memory directory paths — mode-adaptive:
    - agent mode: Memory Dir / Project Dir / User Project Dir;
    - code mode: Coding Memory Dir / Project Dir / User Project Dir.
  - `Enter` opens the selected directory in the system file manager directly.
- Tab completion:
  - `/memory ` — Suggests subcommands (`edit`, `status`, `toggle`, `open`);
  - `/memory edit ` — Suggests memory file paths (via `getDisplayPath`, relative/tilde-shortened, deduplicated, only existing rule files);
  - `/memory toggle ` — Suggests toggle keys (mode-adaptive, mirrors the current mode's toggle set);
  - All completions support prefix filtering.
- Examples:
  - `/memory` — Open the tabbed console (edit tab)
  - `/memory edit memory/MEMORY.md` — Edit a specific memory file
  - `/memory status` — View detailed status
  - `/memory toggle memory_enabled` — Toggle the master memory switch
  - `/memory open` — View memory directory paths

### `/cron` (Scheduled Task Management)

Manage cron jobs via RPC calls to the backend `CronController`, sharing the same backend logic and data store with the Web UI.

- Alias: `/crontab`
- Subcommands:

### `/skills` (Skills Management)

Manage skills lifecycle: listing, installing, uninstalling, marketplace source management, ClawHub and SkillNet online skill registries.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/skills` or `/skills list` | List skills (grouped: Installed / Available to install) |
| `/skills install <skill>` or `/skills install <slug@clawhub>` or `/skills install <name@skillnet>` or `/skills install <skill@marketplace>` or `/skills install <path_or_url>` | Install a skill: builtin accepts bare name, ClawHub uses `<slug>@clawhub`, SkillNet uses `<name>@skillnet` (auto-searches for URL), marketplace uses `<name>@<marketplace>`, local paths and URLs auto-detected |
| `/skills uninstall <name>` | Uninstall a skill by name |
| `/skills marketplace` or `/skills marketplace list` | List marketplace sources (name, URL, enabled status, last updated) |
| `/skills marketplace add <name> <url>` | Add a new marketplace source |
| `/skills marketplace remove <name>` | Remove a marketplace source (also clears its cache) |
| `/skills marketplace toggle <name> <on or off>` | Enable or disable a marketplace source (`on`/`true`/`1` = enable, otherwise disable) |
| `/skills marketplace clawhub` | View ClawHub token status (configured/not configured) |
| `/skills marketplace clawhub token <value>` | Set ClawHub CLI token |
| `/skills marketplace clawhub token` | View ClawHub token status |
| `/skills skillnet` or `/skills skillnet search <query>` | Search SkillNet skill registry (shows name, description, author, stars, category, URL) |
| `/skills skillnet install <skill_url>` | Install a skill from SkillNet by URL (async download, auto-polls progress) |
| `/skills use <skill_name>, <query>` | Execute a query using a specific skill |

#### Concepts

- **Skill**: An extension capability that can be installed from marketplace sources, ClawHub, SkillNet, builtin directory, or local paths, providing additional functionality to the agent.
- **Builtin skill**: A preset skill shipped with the software. Install using bare skill name (e.g., `/skills install advanced-daily-report`); no marketplace source needed.
- **ClawHub**: An online skill registry ([clawhub.ai](https://clawhub.ai)) hosting community-published skills. Install using `<slug>@clawhub` format, where slug is the skill's unique identifier (not its display name). Requires a ClawHub CLI token to be configured first.
- **SkillNet**: An academic skill registry. Two install methods: `<name>@skillnet` (auto-searches to find URL then installs) and `/skills skillnet install <url>` (direct URL install).
- **Marketplace source**: A remote Git repository that hosts available skills. Each source has a name, URL, and enabled/disabled state.
- **Spec**: The install identifier format supporting: `<skill>@builtin` (builtin), `<slug>@clawhub` (ClawHub), `<skill>@<marketplace>` (Git marketplace); bare names without `@` are auto-detected as builtin if applicable.
- **Local install**: Use `/skills install <path>` to install from a local directory (must contain `SKILL.md`) or remote archive URL; paths/URLs are auto-detected and routed to the local import flow.
- **Install location**: The directory where a skill is stored after installation (`~/.jiuwenswarm/agent/workspace/skills/`).
- **Source tag**: Each skill in the list is tagged with its source: `[builtin]` = builtin, `[local]` = imported, `[clawhub]` = ClawHub, `[skillnet]` = SkillNet, `[project]` or marketplace name = other.

#### Grouped List Display

`/skills list` returns skills in two groups:

1. **Installed**: Skills already in the user's skills directory, ready to use.
2. **Available to install**: Builtin skills not yet installed, plus marketplace skills available for installation. Use `/skills install` first.

#### IM vs TUI Differences

Both ultimately request `skills.list`, but trigger methods and display differ.

| Side | Trigger Method | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| IM (Feishu etc. controlled channel) | Exact match `/skills list` (whitespace normalized first) | Gateway intercepts control message and requests `skills.list`, results shown as IM notification/card; standalone `/skills` doesn't go through this control path. |
| TUI (CLI built-in) | Input `/skills` | Locally executes built-in command and calls `skills.list`, displays as grouped list view in session (titles `Installed Skills` and `Available Skills`); shows `No installed skills` when empty. |

For other subcommands (`/skills install`, `/skills uninstall`, `/skills marketplace add/remove/toggle`, `/skills use`), Gateway does **not** intercept them — on the IM side they are treated as regular chat messages. These subcommands are only functional on the TUI (CLI built-in) and Web UI paths, where they send RPC requests directly to AgentServer.

#### Notes

- **Timeout**: `install`, `uninstall`, and `marketplace toggle` requests have a 120-second timeout on the TUI side; other subcommands have no explicit timeout.
- **Builtin auto-detection**: When installing with `/skills install <skill>` (no `@`), the system checks if it matches a builtin skill and redirects to the builtin install flow; if not, a format hint is returned.
- **Path/URL auto-detection**: When installing with `/skills install <path_or_url>` (local path like `/path/to/skill` or `C:\skill`, or remote URL `https://...`), the system automatically routes to the local import flow (`skills.import_local`). All URLs go through import_local; SkillNet is not auto-routed from URLs.
- **`@skillnet` search-install**: When using `/skills install <name>@skillnet`, the frontend first calls `skills.skillnet.search`. **Only auto-installs if an exact match by skill_name is found**; with no exact match, it only displays search results (with URLs and names) without auto-installing the first result — the user must choose one and install via `/skills skillnet install <url>` or `/skills install <exact_name>@skillnet`. This is because SkillNet search is semantic: searching "code" may return "taskflow", "coding-agent" etc. whose names don't contain "code".
- **ClawHub token required**: A ClawHub CLI token must be configured before installing from ClawHub (via `/skills marketplace clawhub token <value>`). Without a token, `@clawhub` installs will fail with a message explaining how to set the token. Obtain your token at [clawhub.ai](https://clawhub.ai).
- **ClawHub slug vs. display name**: ClawHub skills are identified by their unique **slug** (e.g., `code-review-security`), not their display name (e.g., "Code Review Assistant"). When a direct slug install fails, the system automatically searches ClawHub and displays matching results (with real slugs and summaries) to help you find the correct skill.
- **ClawHub overwrite confirmation**: When the target slug already exists (same name from any source counts as installed), TUI presents an interactive prompt: "Skill xxx is already installed. Do you want to force overwrite?". Choosing "Yes" re-installs with `force: true`, replacing the old skill; choosing "No" or exiting keeps the existing skill unchanged. The Web UI bypasses confirmation and uses `force: true` directly.
- **SkillNet async install**: SkillNet installation is asynchronous — it initiates a download task and returns an `install_id`, then TUI automatically polls `install_status` every 800ms until completion or failure (max wait: 15 minutes). Progress is shown as `Downloading... (install_id: xxx)`.
- **SkillNet overwrite confirmation**: Same as ClawHub — TUI prompts the user interactively when a skill already exists. Web UI uses `force: true` directly.
- **SkillNet accessible in China**: SkillNet search API is hosted at `http://api-skillnet.openkg.cn` (OpenKG platform) and is directly accessible in China without VPN. However, the skill content itself is hosted on GitHub, which may require VPN.
- **Same-name skills cannot coexist**: Skills are stored as directories at `skills/{name}/`, and the filesystem does not allow two directories with the same name. Installing a skill with the same name from a different source will overwrite the previous one (with user confirmation). `/skills use` only uses the skill name and cannot distinguish between sources.
- **ClawHub network access**: ClawHub API is hosted at `https://clawhub.ai`. VPN may be required in regions with restricted access to this domain.
- **Cache cleanup**: `marketplace remove` sends `{ name, remove_cache: true }` to also clear the local cache for that source.
- **Auto-refresh**: `marketplace add`, `marketplace remove`, and `marketplace toggle` automatically re-list marketplace sources after a successful operation.
- **Offline handling**: `/skills use` checks connection status; if offline, shows `offline: waiting for reconnect before sending /skills use request`.

#### Examples

### `/export` (Export Conversation)

Export the current conversation to a file or clipboard.

#### Usage

- `/export` — Copy conversation to clipboard (no filename argument)
- `/export <filename>` — Save conversation to a `.txt` file in workspace directory

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/export` | Copy entire conversation to clipboard; if clipboard unavailable, prompt to specify a filename |
| `/export <filename>` | Write conversation to `filename.txt` in workspace directory; if filename lacks `.txt` extension, it is automatically appended |

#### Output Format

The exported text renders each conversation entry with a timestamp and role prefix:

- `[User] <timestamp>` — User input
- `[Assistant] <timestamp>` — Assistant response
- `[Thinking] <timestamp>` — Internal reasoning trace
- `[Tools] <timestamp>` — Tool calls with name, summary, and truncated result (max 500 chars)
- `[System] / [Error] / [Info] <timestamp>` — System messages
- `[Diff] <timestamp>` — Per-turn file change summary

#### Tab Completion

When typing `/export ` and pressing Tab, auto-generated filename suggestions appear:

- `<timestamp>-<sanitized-first-prompt>.txt` — Based on the first user message (truncated to 50 chars, sanitized)
- `conversation-<timestamp>.txt` — Generic timestamped name

Timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss`.

#### Behavior Details

- **Clipboard fallback**: If no filename is given and clipboard is unavailable, an error message prompts the user to specify a filename instead.
- **Filename normalization**: Any extension is replaced with `.txt`; e.g., `/export my-chat.json` becomes `my-chat.txt`.
- **Write location**: Files are saved to `ctx.getWorkspaceDir()` (or `process.cwd()` as fallback).

#### Examples

- `/export` — Copy conversation to clipboard
- `/export my-chat` — Save to `my-chat.txt` in workspace
- `/export 2026-05-09-debug-session.txt` — Save with explicit timestamp name

### `/simplify` (Code Simplify Review)

Parsed **locally by the TUI**, this command sends a dedicated RPC `command.simplify` to get a server-generated three-phase review prompt, then injects it as an Agent message (`logAsUser: false`). The Agent automatically reviews changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, and directly fixes issues found.

- **Scope**: reuse / quality / efficiency **only**. Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, hard-coded secrets, auth flaws, etc.) are **out of scope** — do not fix or report them here. Use `/security-review` for a read-only security report.
- **Alias**: None.
- **Applicable modes**: **`code.*` only**. Non-code mode shows an error prompting `Run /mode code first`.
- **Parsing location**: TUI local (not a Gateway controlled channel); unavailable in IM.

#### Usage

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/simplify` | Review current git changes (or recently edited files) and auto-fix issues |
| `/simplify <target>` | Add focus: file path, module name, or specific review dimension |

#### Execution Flow

1. **TUI validates**: Confirms current mode starts with `code.`; errors otherwise.
2. **RPC request**: Calls `command.simplify` (with optional `target`), 30-second timeout.
3. **Server generates prompt**: Builds a three-phase review instruction from `_SIMPLIFY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`; appends `## Additional Focus` section if `target` is provided.
4. **Injects into Agent**: TUI calls `ctx.sendMessage(prompt, ..., { logAsUser: false })` to inject the prompt; the Agent begins execution.
5. **Offline handling**: Shows a retry message if offline.

#### Three-Phase Review

**Phase 1 — Identify Changes**: Run `git diff` (or `git diff HEAD` for staged changes) to find changed files. If no git changes, review recently edited files from the conversation.

**Phase 2 — Launch Three Review Agents in Parallel** (use sub-agent tools if available; otherwise perform all reviews directly):

| Review Dimension | Focus Areas |
|---|---|
| **Code Reuse Review** | Existing utilities/helpers that could replace new code; duplicated functionality; hand-rolled logic that could use an existing utility |
| **Code Quality Review** | Redundant state; parameter sprawl; copy-paste variations; leaky abstractions; stringly-typed code (use existing constants/enums); unnecessary JSX nesting; unnecessary comments (keep only non-obvious WHY) |
| **Efficiency Review** | Unnecessary work (redundant computations, repeated I/O, N+1 patterns); missed concurrency; hot-path bloat; recurring no-op updates; TOCTOU anti-patterns; memory leaks / missing cleanup; overly broad operations |

**Phase 3 — Fix Issues**: Aggregate all findings and fix each issue directly. Skip false positives without argument. Briefly summarize what was fixed (or confirm the code was already clean).

#### Examples

- `/simplify` — Review all changes
- `/simplify src/auth/` — Focus on changes under `src/auth/`
- `/simplify focus on error handling patterns` — Emphasize error handling

### `/sandbox` (Sandbox Mode Management)

Enter / leave jiuwenbox sandbox mode and tune its runtime policy. Calls `command.sandbox` on the agent server.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/sandbox` or `/sandbox status` | Show current runtime (`enabled`, `landlock`, `excluded_commands`, `files.allow_write`, `files.deny_write`) |
| `/sandbox enable` | Enter sandbox mode (spawns jiuwenbox if needed, rebuilds agent) |
| `/sandbox disable` | Leave sandbox mode (rebuilds agent; stops jiuwenbox only if jiuwenswarm started it) |
| `/sandbox exclude add <pattern>` | Add a shell glob whose matches run locally instead of in the sandbox |
| `/sandbox exclude remove <pattern>` | Remove a pattern |
| `/sandbox exclude list` | List current `excluded_commands` |
| `/sandbox files allow <path>` | Allow write access to `<path>` inside the sandbox (shown as rw) |
| `/sandbox files deny <path>` | Deny write access to `<path>` inside the sandbox (read still allowed, shown as ro) |
| `/sandbox files remove <path>` | Remove `<path>` from the user-configured allow & deny sets |
| `/sandbox files list` | List effective `allow_write` / `deny_write` |
| `/sandbox help` | Print usage |

#### Concepts

- **Platform support**: `/sandbox` is Linux-only (jiuwenbox depends on Linux kernel features such as bwrap, Landlock, and Linux namespaces). On a Windows or macOS agent-server, every `/sandbox` sub-command returns a `SANDBOX_BAD_REQUEST` error. If the TUI runs on Windows/macOS but the agent-server is on a Linux host, the command works — what matters is the agent-server's platform.
- **Write policy semantics**: `allow` / `deny` control **write access** (rw/ro) inside the sandbox, not Unix octal modes. Enforcement uses bwrap bind mounts + `--remount-ro`; Landlock is defense-in-depth (when `landlock.compatibility=disabled`, bwrap is primary).
- **Nested paths**: Supported: parent allow + child deny (e.g. allow `/tmp`, deny `/tmp/secret`). Not supported: child allow + parent deny (parent deny wins); the server rejects such configs.
- **Effective write policy**: `files.allow_write` / `files.deny_write` in the status panel show the merged view of auto-managed and user-configured entries, each labeled `(rw)` or `(ro)`.
- **preserve_file_sharing_mode**: Controlled by jiuwenswarm config, not by `/sandbox`. Only `mount` is supported: intrinsic files and `project_dir` are bind-mounted into the sandbox and `project_dir/config/config.yaml` is explicitly added to `deny_write`. Writing any other value into config.yaml is rejected by the server.
- **excluded_commands**: `fnmatch` per simple-command leaf (full leaf text or command name). All matches → whole command on host; none → whole command in sandbox; mixed leaves → local bash orchestrates and wraps remote leaves with `jiuwenbox sandbox exec` (CLI required).
- **Add / remove are strict**: `exclude add` rejects a pattern that is already in the list; `exclude remove` rejects a pattern that is not in the list. `files allow|deny` rejects a path that is already in the same bucket, and rejects a path that exists in the opposite bucket (allow vs deny conflict) — run `files remove` first if you want to flip it. `files remove` rejects paths that have no matching user-configured entry.
- **enable / disable**: Triggers an agent rebuild. The response lists `rebuilt_modes` (typically `agent.*` / `code.*`) and the jiuwenbox endpoint.

#### Examples

- `/sandbox enable` — turn on sandbox mode
- `/sandbox status` — see runtime + effective files
- `/sandbox files allow ./tmp/` — allow sandbox write access to `./tmp/` (rw)
- `/sandbox files deny ./tmp/secret/` — deny write under an allowed parent (ro)
- `/sandbox exclude add "git *"` — let `git` run on the host instead of inside the sandbox

### `/keybindings` (Keyboard Shortcuts)

View, edit, or reset TUI keyboard shortcuts. Config file: `~/.jiuwenswarm-tui/keybindings.json`.

#### Usage

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/keybindings` | Same as `/keybindings edit` |
| `/keybindings edit` | Create or open the config file; reload after the external editor closes |
| `/keybindings list` | List effective shortcuts grouped by context |
| `/keybindings reset` | Delete user config and restore built-in defaults |

Alias: `/keybind`.

#### Notes

- Built-in defaults are merged with user JSON per **context**; set a key to `null` to unbind a default.
- Key ids must match pi-tui `matchesKey` format (`ctrl`/`shift`/`alt` + main key); chords are not supported.
- **Unsupported keys**:
  - **`win` / `cmd` / `super` / `meta`**: These modifiers require the Kitty keyboard protocol, which is not available in standard terminals (Windows CMD, VS Code integrated terminal, etc.). Bindings using these will never fire.
  - **`ctrl+shift+letter`**: On legacy terminals like Windows CMD, `ctrl+shift+l` and `ctrl+l` produce the same byte — the terminal cannot distinguish them. This combination is not recommended. Use Windows Terminal, WezTerm, or another VT-mode capable terminal if you need these combos.
  - **Chords** (space-separated multi-key sequences, e.g. `"ctrl+x ctrl+k"`): Not supported in the current version.
- **Non-rebindable**: `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+d`, `ctrl+m` (reserved keys).
- Select-list navigation, config editor text input, Resume preview/rename sub-states, etc. remain hardcoded.

See the Chinese [TUI User Guide · Keyboard shortcuts](../zh/TUI使用指南.md#快捷键) for the full context/action reference.

### `/hooks` (Browse Hooks Configuration)

View a summary of all hooks configured in `config.yaml` (read-only).

#### Usage

- `/hooks` (no parameters, no subcommands)

#### Data Source

The TUI requests the Gateway via the `hooks.list` RPC, which loads the `hooks` section from `config.yaml` and returns a summary.

#### Display Contents

`/hooks` displays hooks configuration in three levels:

1. **Event List (Level 1)**: All events sorted by hook count in descending order. Each row shows event name and hook count; the description column shows hook count distribution per matcher.
2. **Status Panel**:
   - `Source` — Configuration source (`config.yaml`)
   - `Global Status` — Global toggle state (`enabled` / `DISABLED`)
   - `Total Hooks` — Total hook count across all events
   - `Active Events` — Events with at least 1 hook / total events (out of 17)
3. **Hook Detail Cards (Level 2)**: Grouped by `Event > Matcher`, each hook shows:
   - `Type` — `command` (shell command) or `prompt` (LLM review)
   - `Command` / `Prompt` — The hook content
   - `Timeout` — Timeout in seconds
   - `Shell` — Execution shell (command hooks only)
   - `Status` — Status message

#### When No Hooks Are Configured

If `config.yaml` has no hooks configured, displays `No hooks configured.` with a hint to use `/config edit` to configure them.

#### Hooks Concept Overview

Hooks are extension logic that executes automatically when specific events fire. 17 events are supported:

| Event | Execution Layer | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` | Agent Rail | Before a tool call |
| `PostToolUse` | Agent Rail | After a successful tool call |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | Agent Rail | After a failed tool call |
| `Stop` | Agent Rail | After agent response completes |
| `PermissionRequest` | Agent Rail | On permission request |
| `PermissionDenied` | Agent Rail | On permission denied |
| `SubagentStart` | Agent Rail | When a sub-agent starts |
| `SubagentStop` | Agent Rail | When a sub-agent stops |
| `BeforeModelCall` | Agent Rail | Before a model call |
| `AfterModelCall` | Agent Rail | After a model call |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Gateway | User submits a message |
| `SessionStart` | Gateway | Session starts |
| `SessionEnd` | Gateway | Session ends |
| `Notification` | Gateway | Notification is sent |
| `ConfigChange` | Gateway | Configuration changes |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | Gateway | Instructions are loaded |
| `Setup` | Gateway | Initialization |

Two hook types are supported:

| Type | Description | Key Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | Executes a shell command (subprocess). Receives JSON context via `$ARGUMENTS` env var. Exit code 0 = success, 2 = block. | `command`, `timeout` (default 30s), `shell` (default bash) |
| `prompt` | Invokes LLM review. `$ARGUMENTS` in the template is replaced with JSON context, `$TOOL_NAME` with the tool name. LLM response JSON with `decision: "block"` blocks the operation. | `prompt`, `timeout` (default 15s), `model` |

- **Blocking**: Exit code 2 (command) or `decision: "block"` (prompt) blocks the current operation (e.g., skip tool call) and feeds the reason back to the model.
- **Input Modification**: PreToolUse hooks can modify tool input parameters via `modifiedInput` in stdout JSON.
- **Additional Context**: Extra information can be injected into tool results or model context via `additionalContext` in stdout JSON.
- **Global Toggle**: `hooks.disable_all_hooks: true` in `config.yaml` disables all hooks.

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "write_file"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "echo 'write_file about to execute' >> /tmp/hooks.log"
          timeout: 10
    - matcher: "bash|run_command"
      hooks:
        - type: prompt
          prompt: "Review if this command is safe: $ARGUMENTS"
          timeout: 20
  SessionStart:
    - matcher: "*"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "echo 'Session started: $ARGUMENTS' >> /tmp/hooks.log"
```

#### Example

- `/hooks` — Browse all current hooks configuration

### `/agents` (Agent Management)

Manage custom agents (subagents) throughout their full lifecycle: view, create, update, enable/disable, and delete. Agent definitions are stored as Markdown files and support four-level source priority merging.

- **Parsing location**: TUI local parsing, calling backend `agents.*` endpoints via RPC.
- **Applicable modes**: All.
- **Note**: This command is registered as hidden (`hidden: true`) and does not appear in `/help` listings but can be used directly.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/agents` or `/agents list` | List all agents (name, source, enabled status, description summary) |
| `/agents get <name>` | View full details of a specific agent (including System Prompt) |
| `/agents create [--project\|--local] <name> <description>` | Create a custom agent; LLM auto-generates the prompt |
| `/agents update <name> [--generate] <new description>` | Update agent description; add `--generate` to have LLM rewrite the prompt |
| `/agents enable <name>` | Enable a custom agent (cannot operate on builtin agents) |
| `/agents disable <name>` | Disable a custom agent (cannot operate on builtin agents) |
| `/agents delete <name>` | Delete a custom agent (cannot operate on builtin agents) |

#### Agent Sources & Storage

| Source | Storage Location | Priority | Manageable |
|--------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| `builtin` | In-code builtins | Lowest | Cannot enable/disable/delete |
| `local` | `<workspace>/.jiuwenswarm/agents-local/` | Local | Full lifecycle management |
| `user` | `~/.jiuwenswarm/agents/` | User | Full lifecycle management (default `create` location) |
| `project` | `<workspace>/.jiuwenswarm/agents/` | Highest | Full lifecycle management |

Agents with the same name are resolved by `project > user > local > builtin` priority; shadowed agents are marked with `shadowed_by`.

#### Agent Definition Fields

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| `name` | Agent name (unique identifier) |
| `description` | Brief description |
| `prompt` | System Prompt text |
| `source` | Origin (`builtin` / `user` / `project` / `local`) |
| `file_path` | Agent definition file path |
| `model` | Specified model (`null` = use default) |
| `tools` | Available tool list |
| `disallowed_tools` | Disallowed tool list |
| `color` | Display color |
| `permission_mode` | Permission mode |
| `memory_scope` | Memory scope |
| `when_to_use` | When-to-use description |
| `max_iterations` | Max iterations (default 200) |
| `skills` | Associated skill list |
| `enabled` | Enabled status (`true` / `false` / `null`) |
| `shadowed_by` | Which source shadows this agent (`null` = active) |

#### `/agents create` Behavior

- **Argument parsing**: `--project` / `--local` are positional flags and must precede the name (e.g., `/agents create --project my-agent description`).
- **LLM generation**: By default, the current model auto-generates `when_to_use` and `system_prompt`; falls back to a built-in template on failure.
- **Auto-enable**: After creation, automatically writes `react.subagents.<name>.enabled = true` to `config.yaml` and hot-reloads the configuration.
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds.
- **Output**: Displays LLM generation marker, storage location, and file path.

#### `/agents update` Behavior

- **No description**: When no description is provided, shows current agent details (same as `get`) and prints usage.
- **`--generate`**: Explicitly triggers LLM prompt rewriting; without this flag, the request's template values are used.
- **Auto hot-reload**: Configuration is automatically reloaded after update.

#### `/agents enable` / `disable` Constraints

- Builtin agents (`source == "builtin"`) cannot be enabled/disabled; the backend returns an error.
- The operation writes to `config.yaml`'s `react.subagents.<name>.enabled` and hot-reloads.

#### `/agents delete` Constraints

- Builtin agents cannot be deleted.
- After deletion, the entry is automatically removed from `config.yaml`'s `react.subagents` and hot-reloaded.

#### `/agents get` Display

Displays all agent definition fields as key-value pairs, with the full System Prompt text appended at the end.

#### Tab Completion

The `get`, `update`, `enable`, `disable`, and `delete` subcommands support Tab completion on agent names (fetched via the `agents.list` RPC).

#### Examples

```bash
/agents                            # List all agents
/agents list                       # Same as above
/agents get Explore                # View Explore agent details
/agents create bug-hunter Root cause analysis expert     # Create user-level agent
/agents create --project proj-agent Project-level        # Create project-level agent
/agents create --local local-agent Local use only        # Create local agent
/agents update bug-hunter --generate Better description  # Update with LLM prompt rewrite
/agents enable bug-hunter           # Enable agent
/agents disable bug-hunter          # Disable agent
/agents delete my-agent             # Delete agent
```

### `/status` (Show Status)

Display jiuwenswarm runtime status: overview, usage statistics, or config editor.

#### Usage

- `/status` or `/status overview` — Show core identity, model/API info, MCP servers, and config sources
- `/status usage` — Show session token usage statistics
- `/status config` — Enter interactive config editor

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Show full status overview (version, session, model, connection, MCP servers, config) |
| `/status overview` | Same as `/status` — explicit overview subcommand |
| `/status usage` | Show session token usage (input, output, total, per-model breakdown) |
| `/status config` | Enter interactive config editor (same as `/config edit`) |

#### Overview Display Sections

When `/status` is run, four key-value panels are displayed:

1. **Core identity**: version, session ID, session name (or prompt to `/rename`), cwd, current mode
2. **Model & API**: model name, provider, API base URL, connection status
3. **MCP servers**: each server's name, transport type, and enabled/disabled state
4. **Config sources**: config file path and all settings source paths

#### Usage Display

`/status usage` shows token consumption for the current session:

- Total input tokens, output tokens, and total tokens
- Per-model breakdown: model name, token count, input/output split

#### Interactive Mode

If the TUI provides an interactive StatusView (`ctx.enterStatusView`), `/status` opens the full status UI with tabs. The subcommand argument selects the initial tab:

- `/status` → opens on overview tab
- `/status usage` → opens on usage tab
- `/status config` → opens on config tab

If StatusView is unavailable, the command falls back to inline key-value display.

#### Data Sources

- Overview data: `command.status` RPC request to AgentServer
- Usage data: `ctx.getUsageSummary()` from local session tracking
- Config data: `config.get` RPC request to AgentServer

#### Examples

- `/status` — Show full overview
- `/status overview` — Show overview (explicit)
- `/status usage` — Show token usage
- `/status config` — Open config editor

### `/statusline` (TUI Footer Status Bar)

Configure the TUI footer status bar with a custom shell command that dynamically displays session info (mode, model, cwd, etc.), modeled after Claude Code's `/statusline` implementation.

#### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/statusline` or `/statusline get` | View current status line configuration |
| `/statusline set <shell-command>` | Set the status line command (its output will appear in the TUI footer) |
| `/statusline padding <number>` | Set left and right padding; the value must be zero or a positive integer and a status line must already be configured |
| `/statusline clear` | Remove the status line configuration (footer bar will hide) |
| `/statusline help` | Show usage guide (writing patterns, practical examples, field list) |
| `/statusline json` | Show the actual current JSON data values (useful for debugging jq expressions) |
| `/statusline <prompt>` | Ask the Agent to generate and configure a status-line script from a natural-language description |

#### Concepts

- **StatusLine**: A text area at the bottom of the TUI that displays user-defined dynamic information, supporting multi-line output. When a custom statusline is configured, the built-in status line is automatically hidden to avoid redundant information.
- **Shell command**: The configured shell command is automatically executed every 2 seconds; its stdout output is rendered as the status bar text.
- **Agent-generated mode**: Any non-empty argument that is not a known subcommand (`set`, `padding`, `clear`, `help`, `json`, or `get`) is sent to the Agent with the `script-creator` skill. For example: `/statusline show mode, model, and remaining context`. Running `/statusline` with no arguments still only shows the current configuration.
- **JSON input**: Each execution receives current session info as JSON, which can be parsed with `jq` or other tools. On POSIX (Linux/macOS), JSON is passed via stdin pipe; on Windows, due to MSYS2 pipe inheritance limitations, the system automatically writes JSON to a temp file and replaces `$(cat)` in the command with `$(cat "filepath")` — the user doesn't need to modify their command format.
- **Prerequisites**: Requires `jq` (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for JSON parsing; Windows users also need to add Git Bash's `usr\bin` directory to the system PATH (e.g., `E:\Git\usr\bin`).

#### JSON Input Fields

The command receives the following JSON data on each execution:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `session_id` | Current session ID |
| `session_name` | Session title (set via `/rename`) |
| `cwd` | Current working directory |
| `mode` | Current mode (`agent.plan` / `agent.fast` / `code.normal` / `code.team` / `team`) |
| `model` | Current model name |
| `provider` | Model provider |
| `version` | jiuwenswarm version |
| `connection` | Connection status (`idle` / `connecting` / `connected` / `reconnecting` / `auth_failed`) |
| `theme` | Current theme name |
| `accent_color` | Current accent color name |
| `transcript_mode` | Transcript display mode (`compact` / `detailed`) |
| `transcript_fold_mode` | Fold mode (`none` / `tools` / `thinking` / `all`) |
| `is_processing` | Whether agent is working (`true` / `false`) |
| `is_paused` | Whether paused (`true` / `false`) |
| `is_interrupted` | Whether interrupted (`true` / `false`) |
| `cancellable_work` | Whether there is running work (`true` / `false`) |
| `streaming_state` | Streaming state (`idle` / `streaming` / `tool_call` / `tool_result`) |
| `last_error` | Last error message or `null` |
| `evolution_status` | Evolution status (`idle` / `running`) |
| `active_subtask_count` | Number of active subtasks |
| `todo_count` | Number of todo items |
| `trusted_dirs` | Trusted workspace directories (array of path strings) |
| `usage.total_input_tokens` | Total input tokens for session |
| `usage.total_output_tokens` | Total output tokens for session |
| `usage.total_tokens` | Total tokens for session |
| `context_window.context_window_size` | Model max context window tokens (e.g. 200000) |
| `context_window.used_percentage` | Context occupancy percentage (0-100) |
| `context_window.remaining_percentage` | Context remaining percentage (0-100) |

#### Command Writing Template

Use the following template to write commands. `input=$(cat)` reads JSON into a variable, then `echo "$input" | jq -r .field` extracts each field. `// "default"` is jq's fallback syntax — when a field is null or empty, the default value is used.

**General formula**:

```
/statusline set 'input=$(cat); field1=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.field1 // "default"'); field2=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.field2 // "default"'); echo "format string"'
```

**Recommended universal command** (shows mode, model, tokens, context %, connection):

```
/statusline set 'input=$(cat); mode=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.mode // "?"'); model=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model // "?"'); tokens=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.usage.total_tokens // 0'); pct=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.used_percentage // 0'); conn=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.connection // "?"'); echo "$mode | $model | ctx:${pct}% | tokens:$tokens | $conn"'
```

**Field extraction quick reference**:

| Field to display | jq syntax |
|---|---|
| Session name | `jq -r '.session_name // ""'` |
| Working directory | `jq -r '.cwd // "?"'` |
| Mode | `jq -r '.mode // "?"'` |
| Model name | `jq -r '.model // "?"'` |
| Provider | `jq -r '.provider // "?"'` |
| Version | `jq -r '.version // "?"'` |
| Connection | `jq -r '.connection // "?"'` |
| Is processing | `jq -r '.is_processing // false'` |
| Is paused | `jq -r '.is_paused // false'` |
| Streaming state | `jq -r '.streaming_state // "idle"'` |
| Last error | `jq -r '.last_error // ""'` |
| Evolution status | `jq -r '.evolution_status // "idle"'` |
| Subtask count | `jq -r '.active_subtask_count // 0'` |
| Todo count | `jq -r '.todo_count // 0'` |
| Trusted dirs | `jq -r '(.trusted_dirs // []) | join(" ")'` |
| Total input tokens | `jq -r '.usage.total_input_tokens // 0'` |
| Total output tokens | `jq -r '.usage.total_output_tokens // 0'` |
| Total tokens | `jq -r '.usage.total_tokens // 0'` |
| Context window size | `jq -r '.context_window.context_window_size // 0'` |
| Context used % | `jq -r '.context_window.used_percentage // 0'` |
| Context remaining % | `jq -r '.context_window.remaining_percentage // 0'` |

#### More Examples

- `/statusline` — View current configuration
- `/statusline set 'input=$(cat); model=$(echo "$input" | jq -r .model); echo "$model"'` — Show model name only
- `/statusline set 'input=$(cat); proc=$(echo "$input" | jq -r .is_processing); model=$(echo "$input" | jq -r .model); echo "$proc | $model"'` — Show processing state and model
- `/statusline set 'input=$(cat); pct=$(echo "$input" | jq -r .context_window.used_percentage); rem=$(echo "$input" | jq -r .context_window.remaining_percentage); cw=$(echo "$input" | jq -r ".context_window.context_window_size / 1000"); echo "ctx:${pct}% used (${rem}% left, ${cw}K window)"'` — Show context window occupancy with percentage bar
- `/statusline set 'input=$(cat); pct=$(echo "$input" | jq -r ".context_window.used_percentage // 0"); if [ "$pct" -ge 90 ]; then warn="⚠HIGH"; elif [ "$pct" -ge 70 ]; then warn="~MED"; else warn="OK"; fi; echo "ctx:${pct}% $warn"'` — Show context % with threshold warning (≥90% HIGH, ≥70% MED)
- `/statusline set 'input=$(cat); err=$(echo "$input" | jq -r .last_error); if [ "$err" != "null" ] && [ "$err" != "" ]; then echo "error: $err"; else echo "ok"; fi'` — Show error when present, otherwise "ok"
- `/statusline set 'input=$(cat); dirs=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.trusted_dirs // [] | join(" ")'); mode=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.mode // "?"'); echo "$mode | dirs:$dirs"'` — Show mode and trusted workspace directories
- `/statusline clear` — Remove status line configuration
- `/statusline help` — View usage guide (writing patterns, practical examples, available fields)
- `/statusline json` — View actual current JSON data values (useful for debugging jq expressions)

#### Behavior Details

- **Poll frequency**: The configured command runs every 2 seconds automatically.
- **Timeout protection**: Individual executions timeout after 3 seconds; no impact on subsequent polls.
- **Output limit**: Command output over 10KB is truncated; display width auto-fits the TUI terminal width.
- **Failure silence**: Command execution failures don't show errors; previous successful output is kept or the bar hides.
- **Persistence**: Configuration is saved in `~/.jiuwenswarm-tui/config.json` under the `statusLine` field; restored on TUI restart.
- **Alias**: `/sl`
- **Windows adaptation**: The system automatically replaces `$(cat)` with reading from a temp file; the user's command format remains unchanged. Git Bash's `usr\bin` must be in the system PATH.

#### Config File Structure

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "input=$(cat); mode=$(echo \"$input\" | jq -r '.mode // \"?\"'); model=$(echo \"$input\" | jq -r '.model // \"?\"'); pct=$(echo \"$input\" | jq -r '.context_window.used_percentage // 0'); tokens=$(echo \"$input\" | jq -r '.usage.total_tokens // 0'); echo \"$mode | $model | ctx:${pct}% | tokens:$tokens\"",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

### `/auto-harness` (Auto-Harness Task Management)

Manage Auto-Harness task creation, execution, and monitoring. Auto-Harness generates harness extension packages via automated pipelines, supporting two pipeline types:

- **optimize_expert_harness** (backend value `extended_evolve_pipeline`): Generate a local harness extension package
- **optimize_meta_harness** (backend value `meta_evolve_pipeline`): Submit PR (requires git config)

During pipeline execution, extension packages are **activated automatically by default** — no manual user confirmation is needed. Logs display `harness.extension_ready` (extension ready, showing directory and component info) and `harness.activate_interaction` (activation confirmation prompt) events.

#### Configuration Requirements

Using the `optimize_meta_harness` pipeline requires the following fields to be configured (via `/config edit` or `/status config`):

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `git.user_name` | Yes | Git commit username |
| `git.user_email` | Yes | Git commit email |
| `git.fork_owner` | Yes | Fork repository owner (e.g., `SnapeK`) |
| `gitcode.access_token` | No | GitCode API token (can also be provided via environment variable `GITCODE_ACCESS_TOKEN`) |

If configuration is incomplete, the task creation will prompt the missing fields.

#### Subcommands

### `/btw` (By-the-way Side Question)

Parsed **locally by the TUI**, this command sends a dedicated RPC `command.btw` to AgentServer to run an isolated, tool-free, single-turn LLM query against the current conversation context. It answers a quick side question **without interrupting the main conversation**.

- **Alias**: None.
- **Applicable modes**: All.
- **Constraint**: A question must be provided; returns `no_context` when no conversation context exists yet.

#### Usage

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/btw <question>` | Ask a side question based on current conversation context |

#### Behavior Details

- **Required argument**: `/btw` must include a question; otherwise shows `Usage: /btw <your question>`.
- **Thinking indicator**: Displays `💭 Answering: <question>` (dim style) while the request is in flight.
- **RPC timeout**: 120 seconds.
- **Server-side handling**:
  - Backend receives the request via `command.btw` RPC and obtains the current Agent instance.
  - Shares the main Agent's system prompt (project context, skills, CLAUDE.md, etc.) and retrieves recent conversation messages as context.
  - Builds a dedicated btw prompt with a `<system-reminder>` telling the model: no tools available, single response only, main Agent is not interrupted.
  - Calls the model directly (no tools, single-turn), without modifying conversation history (read-only).
- **Return statuses**:
  - `ok`: Displays `💡 /btw <question>` + answer content.
  - `no_context`: Shows `No conversation context available yet — send a message first.`
  - `failed`: Shows error message or `Couldn't answer the side question.`

#### Examples

- `/btw what does git status do?`
- `/btw What is the time complexity of this code?`

### `/review` (Code Review a Pull Request)

When entered in the **TUI**, sends the raw `/review` text as a chat message to the Gateway. The Gateway recognizes it, injects a review prompt, and the Agent uses `gh` CLI to review the PR.

In **IM controlled channels** (Feishu etc.), the Gateway intercepts `/review`, injects the prompt, and forwards to AgentServer for execution.

- **Alias**: None.
- **Applicable modes**: All (Agent, Code, Team).
- **Parsing location**: Gateway controlled channel (`scope: "gateway"`); TUI sends as a chat message.

#### Usage

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/review` | Without arguments, the Agent runs `gh pr list` to show open PRs |
| `/review <PR number or URL>` | Review a specific PR: Agent runs `gh pr view/diff` and analyzes |

#### Behavior Details

- **TUI execution**: Sends `/review [args]` as a user message via `ctx.sendMessage()`; shows `offline: waiting for reconnect before sending review request` if offline.
- **Gateway interception** (IM side):
  - Matches exact `/review` or prefix `/review <arg>`.
  - Argument max 2048 bytes; control characters rejected with an error notice.
  - Injects the review prompt into `msg.params["query"]` and continues forwarding to AgentServer.
- **Agent execution**: Upon receiving the review prompt, the Agent uses `gh` CLI:
  1. Without arguments: runs `gh pr list` to display open PRs.
  2. With arguments: runs `gh pr view <number>` for details and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
  3. Analyzes changes and provides a comprehensive review (correctness, conventions, performance, test coverage, security).
- **No git/gh pre-check**: The Gateway does not check whether `git` or `gh` is installed; the Agent handles missing tools on its own.

#### Examples

- `/review` — List open PRs in the current repo
- `/review 123` — Review PR #123

### `/security-review` (Security Review)

When entered in the **TUI**, sends the raw `/security-review` text as a chat message to the Gateway. The Gateway recognizes it, injects a security review prompt, and the Agent uses `git` commands to analyze pending changes on the current branch.

In **IM controlled channels** (Feishu etc.), the Gateway intercepts `/security-review`, injects the prompt, and forwards to AgentServer for execution.

- **Alias**: None.
- **Applicable modes**: All (Agent, Code, Team).
- **Parsing location**: Gateway controlled channel (`scope: "gateway"`); TUI sends as a chat message.

#### Usage

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/security-review` | Review all pending changes on the current branch vs `origin/HEAD` |
| `/security-review <additional instructions>` | Add focus instructions or constraints (e.g., "focus on auth module") |

#### Behavior Details

- **TUI execution**: Sends `/security-review [args]` as a user message via `ctx.sendMessage()`; shows `offline: waiting for reconnect before sending security review request` if offline.
- **Gateway interception** (IM side):
  - Matches exact `/security-review` or prefix `/security-review <arg>`.
  - Argument max 2048 bytes; control characters rejected with an error notice.
  - Injects the security review prompt into `msg.params["query"]` and continues forwarding to AgentServer.
- **Agent execution**: Upon receiving the security review prompt, the Agent performs:
  1. **Repository context research**: `git status`, `git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`, `git log` to understand the change scope.
  2. **Comparative analysis**: `git diff origin/HEAD...` to review diffs file by file.
  3. **Vulnerability assessment** across these categories:
     - Input validation vulnerabilities
     - Authentication and authorization issues
     - Cryptography and key management
     - Injection and code execution
     - Data exposure
  4. Uses subtasks to identify vulnerabilities and parallel subtasks for false-positive filtering; only reports findings with >80% confidence.
  5. Outputs a structured Markdown report: file, line number, severity, category, description, exploit scenario, fix recommendation.
- **Hard exclusion list**: Does not report DoS, secret storage, rate limiting, race conditions, and similar issue types.
- **No git pre-check**: The Gateway does not check whether `git` is installed; the Agent handles this on its own.

#### Examples

- `/security-review` — Review all pending changes on the current branch
- `/security-review focus on authentication module security` — With additional focus instructions
