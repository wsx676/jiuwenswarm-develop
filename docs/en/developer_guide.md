# Developer Guide

This document is intended for developers of the JiuwenSwarm project, covering how to set up a development environment from source and run tests.

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version Requirement | Description |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Operating System | Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Linux | Mainstream OS supported |
| Python | ≥3.11, <3.14 | Python 3.11 recommended |
| Git | Latest | For cloning the repository |
| Node.js | ≥18.x | For frontend interface |
| Bun | Latest | For building TUI frontend packages |

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url> jiuwenswarm
cd jiuwenswarm
```

## 2. Set Up Development Environment with `uv`

### Install `uv`

If you haven't installed `uv` yet, install it first:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

Use `uv` to create a new virtual environment (supports Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13):

```bash
uv venv --python=3.11
```

### Activate the Environment

```bash
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Run uv Sync

Run the following command in the project root directory `jiuwenswarm/`:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command installs all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, including development dependencies (such as `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `pytest-asyncio`, etc.).

## 3. Install Bun (For Building TUI Frontend Packages)

The TUI frontend packages require [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for compilation. Installation methods:

```bash
# macOS, Linux, and WSL
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows (via PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or install via npm
npm install -g bun
```

After installation, verify:

```bash
bun --version
```

## 4. Development

Once the environment is set up, you can start developing the source code and test cases.

### Project Structure Overview

├── tests/
│   ├── unit_tests/       # Unit tests
│   ├── system_tests/     # System tests
│   └── ...
├── docs/                 # Documentation

├── uv.lock               # Dependency lock file
└── pytest.ini            # pytest configuration
```

### Adding Dependencies

- **Runtime dependencies**: `uv add <package>`
- **Development dependencies** (testing, linting, etc.): `uv add --dev <package>`

For example:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest-cov pytest-asyncio
```

### Self-Verification Development Workflow

After modifying code, you need to build and verify according to the type of changes made:

#### One-Command Debug Mode (Recommended)

`debug` mode chains "rebuild + reinstall dependencies + start in background" into a
single command, which is handy for a full verification pass after a change:

```bash
uv run jiuwenswarm-start debug
```

It runs, in order:

1. `npm install` in `jiuwenswarm/channels/web/frontend`
2. `npm run build` in the same directory, regenerating `frontend/dist`
3. `uv sync` at the repository root
4. Starts all services in the background, redirecting terminal output to
   `logs/swarm-<timestamp>.log`

When only Python code changed, the frontend build (steps 1-2) is wasted time -
pass `--skip-build` to reuse the existing `frontend/dist`:

```bash
uv run jiuwenswarm-start debug --skip-build
```

If `frontend/dist` is missing or empty the flag errors out and tells you to run a
full build first, rather than starting a service whose UI would 404.

The terminal then echoes the ports the services actually bound, and they keep
running in the background. Follow the log with:

```bash
tail -f logs/swarm-<timestamp>.log
```

Stop the background service (this also terminates the AgentServer / Gateway / Web
subprocesses it spawned):

```bash
uv run jiuwenswarm-stop
```

Notes:

- `debug` must run from a source checkout (it builds the frontend and runs `uv sync`);
  for a package installation use `jiuwenswarm-start all` instead
- `debug` cannot be combined with `--name` - it only serves the default instance; use
  `jiuwenswarm-start --name <name>` for multi-instance debugging
- Starting a second debug service is refused while one is running; run
  `uv run jiuwenswarm-stop` first
- Log files are never rotated or removed automatically; delete `logs/swarm-*.log`
  manually when they pile up

#### Backend Code Changes

After modifying backend Python code, run the following commands to reinitialize and start the service:

```bash
uv run jiuwenswarm-init
uv run jiuwenswarm-start
```

#### Frontend Code Changes

After modifying frontend code, rebuild the frontend assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### TUI Changes

After modifying TUI (Terminal User Interface) related code, run the development mode for debugging:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 5. Running Tests

> **Important**: Always use `uv run pytest` instead of running `pytest` directly to ensure that dependencies from the `uv`-managed virtual environment are used.

### Run All Unit Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit_tests/
```

### Run All System Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/system_tests/
```

### Run a Specific Test File

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit_tests/agentserver/test_team_config_loader.py
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xxx'`**

Cause: The system `pytest` was run directly without using the `uv` environment. Solution:

```bash
# Wrong - uses system Python
pytest tests/

# Correct - runs through uv
uv run pytest tests/
```

**Issue: `error: unrecognized arguments: --cov=...`**

Cause: `pytest.ini` is configured with the `--cov` parameter, but `pytest-cov` is not installed in the current environment. Solution:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest-cov pytest-asyncio
```

**Issue: Tests fail unexpectedly due to state leakage between tests**

If a test passes when run individually but fails during a full test run, it is usually because a test file modifies `sys.modules` or global state at the module level, affecting the collection or execution of subsequent tests. You can use binary search to locate the issue:

```bash
# Runs successfully on its own
uv run pytest tests/unit_tests/xxx/test_foo.py

```

**Issue: How to install Node.js**

Frontend development requires Node.js. It is recommended to install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager):

```bash
# Install nvm (macOS / Linux)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc

# Install and use Node.js 18
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

Windows users can use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or download the installer directly from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installation, verify the version:

```bash
node --version
# Expected output: v18.x.x or higher
```

## 6. Building Packages

The project supports two distribution formats: **Python wheel packages** (`.whl`) and **desktop executables** (`.exe` / `.dmg`).

### 6.1 Building Wheel Packages

The project contains two independent wheel packages:

| Package | Description | Config File |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `jiuwenswarm` | Backend service main package (includes Web frontend build artifacts) | `pyproject.toml` |
| `jiuwenswarm-tui` | TUI terminal interface sidecar package (includes Bun-compiled native binaries) | `packages/jiuwenswarm-tui/pyproject.toml` |

#### 6.1.1 Build All (Recommended)

Run from the project root directory:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash scripts/build.sh
```

The script will execute the following steps in order:
1. Build the Web frontend (runs `npm run build` in `jiuwenswarm/channels/web/frontend`)
2. Build the main package `jiuwenswarm.whl`
3. If `bun` is detected, continue to build the TUI native binary and `jiuwenswarm-tui.whl`

Artifacts are output to two directories:
- `./dist/jiuwenswarm-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` (main package)
- `./packages/jiuwenswarm-tui/dist/jiuwenswarm_tui-<version>-<platform>.whl` (TUI sidecar package)

#### 6.1.2 Build the jiuwenbox Package Alone

`jiuwenbox` is a standalone sandbox system package (config file: `jiuwenbox/pyproject.toml`). You can skip the main package and TUI sidecar via `scripts/build_python_packages.py` to build only the jiuwenbox wheel:

```bash
python scripts/build_python_packages.py --skip-root --skip-sidecar --clean
```

This command will:

1. Clean `dist/`, `build/`, and `jiuwenbox.egg-info` under `jiuwenbox/` (triggered by `--clean`)
2. Run `uv build --wheel` in the `jiuwenbox/` directory, outputting artifacts to `jiuwenbox/dist/`

Artifact: `./jiuwenbox/dist/jiuwenbox-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`

> Note: `build_python_packages.py` builds the main package, TUI sidecar, and jiuwenbox by default. Use `--skip-root --skip-sidecar` only when you need to produce the jiuwenbox package alone. If all three are skipped (passing `--skip-root --skip-sidecar --skip-jiuwenbox` together), the script exits with an error.

> Note: `jiuwenbox` requires Python `>=3.11`. If the build machine's system Python is below this version, explicitly invoke the script with a 3.11 interpreter (e.g. `python3.11 scripts/build_python_packages.py --skip-root --skip-sidecar --clean`); otherwise the build fails due to dependency resolution errors.

### 6.2 Desktop EXE / DMG Packaging

The desktop version uses [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) to package the Python application into a standalone executable.

#### 6.2.1 Prerequisites

- `uv` and `Node.js` installed
- Install development dependencies via `uv sync --extra dev` (includes PyInstaller)

#### 6.2.2 Windows Packaging (EXE)

**Using batch script (recommended):**

```cmd
scripts\build-exe.bat
```

**Using PowerShell script:**

```powershell
.\scripts\build-exe.ps1
```

Output: `dist\jiuwenswarm\jiuwenswarm.exe`

#### 6.2.3 macOS Packaging (DMG)

```bash
bash scripts/build-macos.sh
```

The script will execute the following steps in order:
1. Install Python dependencies (`uv sync --extra dev`)
2. Build the Web frontend (`npm run build`)
3. Package with PyInstaller to generate `JiuwenSwarm.app`
4. Create a DMG installer image using `hdiutil`

Output: `dist/JiuwenSwarm-<version>.dmg`
